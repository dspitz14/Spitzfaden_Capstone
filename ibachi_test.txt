AUTOMATIC SERVICE FEE GRATUITY Beware, if you order through any 3rd party app like favor etc. they include a mandatory tip to your total.   Ive been a regular for years. Since new management the prices have gone through the roof, but I stayed because I enjoy the food. Not anymore. Ill gladly take my business down the street to Zen Japanese or Hanabi Sushi for nearly half price of this place.I dont know how this place has 4 stars. First off, it took 15 minutes for our server to come to our table, then another 10 to bring us our drinks (warm beer, delightful), and then probably another 20 to get our sushi to us. The ONLY part that was remotely edible was a couple of pieces of Nigiri. We pushed everything aside and proceeded to wait probably 15 more minutes for our server to reappear, throw us a box, which we didnt need or want, and then ask us how it was. We told her we werent impressed, but she did nothing to mitigate it. $75 for a couple of pieces of sub par sushi. We left upset and still starving. Ended up going to Drinks and getting chicken wings. Seriously, never again. Dont waste your time here. This was our favorite sushi place. We drove all the way from basically Georgetown to eat here all the time. We went here because it had good reviews and yelp you lead us astray! We were really disappointed!  This what we had shrimp and veggie tempura- very greasy, no flavor, shrimp was soggy in the middle, and the tempura was also soggy.  Couldnt finish any of the pieces. Bim Bim Bap- edible? lots of rice, all other ingredients pretty bland. The Bim Bim Bap up the road at Korea House it way better. It comes with lots of little dishes with different flavors. This one just had beef, carrots, bean sprouts, spinach, seaweed all very much lacking flavor. The egg was over cooked and greasy.  It came with a Miso soup- which we had two bites of before pushing aside. (I usually will slurp miso soup down!  ) The bigfoot roll- a sushi roll, was actually a lot better. It had flavor but a very uniform flavor and it was the only thing we finished, so maybe just stick with sushi if you get dragged here by your friends. But at no point did we say  mmm or yum textures were not very good we were just trying to stay positive at this point. The atmosphere had a lot going for it, But everything looked weirdly cleaned  the lamps were very dusty, the tables were greasy/ streaky, and the floors were perfect (you do take off your shoes) The service was quick and friendly. We both got stomach aches too, which at fifty dollars for the whole meal really drove the regret home. We dont get a chance to eat out much these days and it was very sad and frustrating to spend that much money and be so disappointed.  We should of just ordered an appetizer and drinks, taken three bites and walked out with a 20 tab. ( which maybe a good rule of thumb for trying a totally new place)  This place is really kitchen nightmares worthy because with the set up they have it could be a really awesome place.   DK sushi is similarly to this place and a lot better, Kome is expensive but pretty awesome comparatively. Update: we both got diarrhea this morning and there was no romantic activities after the meal. DO NOT EAT HERE! Perhaps I am a little spoiled when asking for salmon and escolar only on my sashimi combo without an upcharge but the chef took care of me and made sure I was happy before I left! The food at Ichiban is just not good. I ordered chicken teriyaki and it had no flavor. The rice and veggies were just ok. The sushi presentation was good but didnt taste like what I ordered should have tasted like. After eating, I looked back at the reviews and noticed the reviews have dropped off since new management took over a few months ago. Wish I had noticed that sooner! The problem with this place is not the food because it tastes good. The problem with this place is its service. I first came here a few years ago and my family and I had to wait 45 minutes for our food. The thing that angered me was that people in front of us were getting their food because they were a larger group. This is unacceptable. I tried this place again recently and everything seemed better, but the crappy service came up again. They had no kimchi (how do you serve Korean food withotu kimchi), no one to refill the water or serve water when we were the only ones eating at the time, hair in the food, etc. As a customer, I do not want to be gambling at a restaurant for decent service and food. It is always a gamble here and I am not willing to risk my meal time for this place anymore. I dont quite understand this restaurant from the moment I walked in. Hoping to get some authentic food and its just bad, along with decor. Well now that is under new management, that has changed. We ordered our food tonight and the sushi was out within 3 minutes, which was nice it was out so fast, but super out of the norm. One of our rolls was burnt and the other two just tasted weird. The didnt taste fresh and had a strange after taste. They came out so fast my husband thought they were premade. Sushi from H-E-B tastes better than what we ate tonight.  We also ordered kids yakitori, which for the price should include rice or something else. It was literally two pieces of overcooked chicken, covered in sauce on screwers.  For an appetizer we ordered calamari, which came out after the sushi and was so hard and chewy that it was barely edible. Some pieces werent edible.  Our waitress was nice, but not attentive. We ordered two lemonades, she only brought us one and we had to have our daughter track her down to get another. We also asked for 2 spicy mayos and had to re-ask her when she forgot and in the end she only brought one. Seriously the only enjoyable part of our dinner was the edamame. The bathrooms have never been great, but this time they were filthy. When is just another slap in the face, after an awful dinner. As much as we used to love this place, I will never go back. Back to the quest of finding sushi in Austin. Waited in line for a long time. When we got sat we waited for a good long while. I finally set a 5 minute alarm and said if no one will help us by the time the alarm goes off we will leave. After 5 minutes of me trying to get peoples attention we left....
