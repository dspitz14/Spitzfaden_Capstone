The café is open 24 hours and they offer salads, sandwiches, wraps and smoothies. A much better alternative to late night French fries or the $19 room service Cobb salad before service charge and gratuity. The staff was friendly except when I asked for some hot sauce to go, one chick said not a word to me and slammed a bottle of Tabasco sauce on the counter in front of me without giving me a Togo Ramekin. I was tempted to walk away with the bottle. But I didn't. My tuna salad wrap was $11 and some change and pretty hearty. I saved the other half for later.\",\n",

I go to a different place for my nails but I heard good things about this place from yelp and my boyfriend who occasionally gets a pedicure from here. Since we were next door at Costco my sister had mentioned she had wanted to get her nails done for her birthday so I recommended that we go there when we were done. \\n\\nUpon arriving we signed in and waited for our turn. I decided to change the polish on my nails so I signed in for both of us. We waited about 5 min and they took me first so I got my polish changed. A few minutes later a different girl had seated my sister and started on her full set. She placed the tip on and started to cut them and then said a different girl would finish and left her sitting there. I don't mind that u needed to leave early she should have just waited for someone to complete the job one time. As I got up from the nail dryer I saw her siting there and asked what's going on. The nail tech next to her said she would finish as soon as she was done with the job she was doing but didn't and started on a pedicure. Meanwhile my sister has been waiting at least 15 min meanwhile the guy there was going to start on someone else when he noticed that she needed to have her nails finished. So he took her and finished them and then she has to go to a third person for the paint and design. \\n\\nI'm rating it 2 stars based on there  service. Granted we did come in at 5 pm and they close at 6 but they were still taking walk ins well after we came in. The wait wasn't the issue for me. I don't mind  waiting just don't have us sit down and then wait for someone to come finish the job. I would have rated 1 star but they offered me water. I'm glad my nail tech is private and I don't have to come to nail establishments like this.\",\n",

The wings were marinated perfectly and also the sauce that came with it was very good. \\n\\nWe had an awesome server (Joey) and we were well taken care of. We simply sat at the bar and watched the chefs do their work. Although, if i were to come next time, i would simply sit at a table. I kind of like my privacy when talking and that you won't have when the chefs are 3ft away from you. \\n\\nPrice for tiger roll i believe was $24 and for the wings $20. So would i come back? Hell Yes!\",\n",

We boarded and were told to de-plane because of an electrical problem.  After four hours, we get back on, only to be told that the problem hasn't been resolved.  Off again.  Eventually, we're told they are getting us a different plane and that we will take off at 6:00.  We'll see.\\n\\nThe issue is not that there was a problem with an Allegiant flight.

       "  'I went here twice and after leaving with a \"eh\" feeling after both visits decided it was time to switch to another dermatologist.\\n\\nMy first visit I specifically requested Dr. Woodson herself after reading a lot of neutral to negative reviews for her PA and NP. After filling out a ton of paperwork (most of which was not very welcoming- I think I signed about three different forms promising I would definitely pay my bill or be sent to a debt collector. I get they want their money, but what a way to greet your new patients!) I went into the exam room and lo and behold PA John Notabartolo walks into the room. Since I was already there I just went with it. He examined my skin (I went in for some mild adult acne) for less than ten seconds, told me basic skin care advice that I\\'ve known about for years, and then wrote me some prescriptions. The whole visit with him lasted about three minutes. No real suggestions or overview of my current skin care regime, no explanation of the possible cause of my condition or what level of severity it was. Basically the only thing I couldn\\'t have found on my own online was the prescriptions.\\n\\nAs another reviewer noted, they tend to prescribe the newest brand name drugs and of course both of mine were brand name and expensive! Thankfully my insurance covered mine with a reasonable co-pay, but definitely double check with your insurance before getting them filled. The prescriptions did help my skin, which was awesome. I went back for a follow up as they\\'d requested to see me in a few weeks and after waiting for over forty minutes past my appointment time was taken back with very little apology for the wait. Again another three minute visit with the PA with another very hurried skin examination and I left wondering why I\\'d wasted two hours of my time and another doctor\\'s bill.\\n\\nOnly one lady at the front desk was very friendly; everyone one else in the office seemed less than thrilled to be there. They did call with appointment reminders, which was nice, however the first time they left a voicemail with the time but not the date, and the second time they left a voicemail with one time and then called back and left another voicemail with a different time. Their bills also have the quickest due date I have ever seen. They give you 10 days from when they print the bill until the due date- but they seem to take 1-2 days to mail the bill (so 8 days left), plus 1-2 days in the mail (6 days left), so by the time you get it you have about 4-5 days to get it in the mail to make sure it arrives on time. You better hope you\\'re not on vacation when they send the bill!\\n\\nThe last in the chain of events to make me move on to a new doctor was when I called to reschedule my third appointment and was put on hold for 7 minutes and then was greeted by a bored sounding woman who barely apologized for the wait. Instead of rescheduling I just asked her to cancel. I hung up and smiled as I realized I\\'d successfully broken up with my doctor.\\n\\nNothing this office did was horrible, but nothing they did was great either. The little moments of what I consider mediocre medical care and blase customer service just added up for me to the point where I didn\\'t want to deal with it anymore. There\\'s plenty of dermatology offices in this city and given the low reviews dating back for years I feel like this office isn\\'t that interested in improving their business- so I\\'ll just take mine elsewhere.',\n",

It\\'s a lot more affordable than other ayce places which will cost me (+ tip) around $30 for dinner. The meat and banchans are pretty good, not crappy at all. They do lack desserts but so does Sura. I guess desserts aren\\'t highlighted in Korean BBQ because people are too stuffed with meat and ran out of room for anything sweet afterwards. Everything they serve on the buffet may not be an A+... maybe a B- \\n\\nThey have at least 4 different marinated meat selections and another 3 or 4 \"dry\" meat which includes beef, pork and chicken. They also serve seafood such as shrimp and squid. They have all sorts of \"salads\" or cold dishes, along side other appetizers? Such as pot stickers and grilled fish. They also serve sushi rolls but I never give those any attention. If I want to eat sushi, ayce Korean BBQ (or any buffet in general) ain\\'t the place. I go to ayce sushi joints for that. They serve rose tea and I\\'m addicted to it. I\\'d drink like 5 servings lol\\n\\nI know there are better places, but you can\\'t beat it for the price. It definitely satisfies my meat cravings ;)',\n",

Their prices, bottle sizes, and flavor selections. \\n\\nI left the strip and made the trek, with my mother (and novice vaper) in tow. I walked in to see luscious clouds billowing about the shop, an amount of people milling about shopping and generally creating rain clouds, as well as a full, busy, and well versed staff manning the counters. \\n\\nI was immediately greeted by a friendly employee, which was beautiful. I asked about where I can view/sample flavors and they enthusiastically directed me to the rear counter. \\n\\nThere were two kind gentleman, busily working, but never neglecting the customers whilst mixing flavors. (Fuck it, we're doing it live)\\n\\nI tell the kind man (I forget his name, but you sir were a saint) that I am a fruit, or floral flavor kind of person. He immediately handed me bottles of fluids to drip and sample. \\n\\nI selected melonlicious, and the creep. My mother selected candy apple. \\n\\nI told them what nic content and pg/vg ratio we were looking for and too my surprise they mixed it right in front of me! (Say what?!)\\n\\nIn the midst of my being starstruck, I ordered a 30ml of melonlicious, and a 120ml of the creep. 3mg nic, 100% vg, because I enjoy my drips. \\n\\nMom got her candy apple at 0mg nic, with a 50/50 blend. \\n\\nWe even got her boyfriend some liquid as well.\\nHe is a tobacco/coffee flavor only kinda guy, and they had,\\n\\nAnd I shit you not\\n\\nThe absolute, most accurate, and flavorful tobacco blend of liquid I have ever tasted in my vaping career. \\n\\nNo really, get in on that. \\n\\nIts called east meets west, and tell them some asshole from california said it was the absolute tits and you need 120ml NOW. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAll together, this was one of the most involved, and positive experiences with a vape shop I have ever experienced. \\n\\nAlso, elephant vapors, if you read this- get a Goddamn website. I need to order more. I cant drive 10+ hours just for the sweet ambrosia you make, but I will gladly pay nearly any price for what you make. \\n\\n\\nElephant vapors: 10/10\\nFlavor: 10/10\\nCustomer service: 10/10\\n\\n\\nYou guys rock!\",\n",

And as a gold member I usually get free upgrades (turns up nose in disdain). So even though we had a standard room (shudders with disgust), I expect at least some basic cleanliness; especially for a hotel with a good reputation.  Instead there was someone's mascara stuck on the mirror, tape and leftover construction paper on top of the doorway (I assume it said something like Last Fling Before the Ring or some other celebratory message), the tile on the bathroom was cracked like the previous vacationers had a WWE match in there, but worst of all, the shower flooded, and oddly enough, the carpet right outside the door got wet even though the tile by the entrance of the bathroom stayed dry.

Needless to say, $60 later I had one of the worst cuts of my life, other than when my mom cut all my hair off in the early 90's...\\n\\nYou all know how terrifying it is to lose your hair dresser, thank you Yelp for being here! I was running errands two weeks ago on a day off from my busy schedule, and decided it was the day to try again. I rely on Yelp for most of what I do, eat, and drink around here because I have lived in Chicago for 27 years of my life.\\n\\nThat being said, I came across Hotbox on Yelp and read the reviews, for those of you that had a bad experience, I feel sorry for you! I was so excited when I walked in! Although it is tough to find from the outside. \\n\\nI was greeted promptly, offered several types of beverages, I chose sangria, and even though I was at minimum 30 minutes early, I was taken right away by Whitney! Boy was I lucky! I told her that I just wanted a good haircut. I didn't want to give her a picture or try to do her job. All the direction given was that I wanted to keep as much length as possible. I told her if she was good I didn't need to tell her what to do!!! She loved it! We got started and the entire process was PERFECT! She did everything she should have through the cutting process. I have worked in several salons in my days and i know what it takes to give a good haircut. I have a lot of hair that is heavy, she dried it completely which is a feat of its own, and then proceeded to flat iron and pin cut (thin) out my layers...she rocks! I told her I would be writing a review for her, thanks Whitney! You rock and I will see you soon!\\n\\nI absolutely enjoyed my experience so much that I purchased $120 worth of Moroccan Oil hair products from her! She was very informative about the product, what it does, and what it is made of. LOVE!\",\n",

My Daughter is sick and now we have to cancel our trip. We turn around and return the car to this location. I dont mind the wait, even if it is 30 min to an hr on a Friday night with 9 CSR computers open and only 2 CSR agents working. I meet CeCe. She is a very nice agent, but tells me unfortunately she will be charging me full price for the day. This was due to the (if you have it for longer than two hours then you pay) policy. Ok I get that you get me for $123.0 for 3 hrs. At least try and save me a little money.  At least she was kind enough to remove the pre paid gas. Just seemed like a hassle. Could be better as I had a similar experience in Phoenix.',\n",

The casino has a young hip vibe but not douchey, and of course, EARL OF SANDWICH. However, this is my first time staying here.\\n\\nUpon checking in, I like to do the '20 Dollar Trick' when I check into Vegas hotels. Sandwich a $20 between your ID and credit card and the front desk staff will upgrade you to a better room. Don't do this because it never works contrary to all the success stories I've read online. All you gotta do is ask politely. The lady hooked it up a strip view room since we originally booked a mountain view room. It was a great view of NYNY, City Center, and the Bellagio Fountains.\\n\\nThe room was pretty nice. We got the Dragnet room (movie starring Dan Aykroyd and Tom Hanks) so there was memorabilia everywhere in the room. We had some issues with the plumbing and there were nicks and stretches on the desks and closets, but that's nothing too big to cry about. \\n\\nWe got the room right off the elevator so you can hear the elevators through the walls, but if you're a deep sleeper it's not a problem. The pool is pretty okay. On weekends, they turn it into a Wet Republic/Rehab place, but on weekdays it's a regular ol pool.\\n\\nWith their location right in the middle of the strip, PH is definitely a place to consider when staying in Vegas.\\n\\nSincerely,\\nThe Duke of Planet Hollywood Hotel and Casino\",\n",

Well, yesterday I forgot my casino card (that gives you a discount)  and the buffet brunch was $2 more at  $18.95. I wasn't THAT hungry.  I always saw a steady flow of customers at the Coronando Cafe so I decided to try it out.  I like the openness in terms of space and seating.  When it gets busy the staff do check on you but the pleasantries go out the door and they are direct. You need this or that? No? Moving on.  Which I don't mind if you are busy.  Now, for the food. I had the Southpoint Special. It's a layered mix of eggs, melted cheese, potatoes, red and green peppers, onions, and your choice of bacon, ham, or sausage.  I ordered it with corned beef hash on the side and wheat toast.  I was expecting small portions but it was pretty big and I couldn't finish it all.  It was delicious!  I think it was the complementary cinnamon coffee cake that started to fill my stomach. Overall I'm satisfied with my experience and will not overlook this little gem again.\",\n",

Just remember though, that you get what you pay for (as in you pay roughly 85 dollar premium for excellent food). But its worth it, so save up and come here for brunch if your ever in Vegas.\\n\\nThe food here was amazing. I am a Seafood lover so I personally enjoyed the seafood offered here. From smoked salmon, Lobster tail, to Lobster bisque, it was amazing. PRAWNS, not shrimp....actual prawns are offered at this amazing brunch. Other seafood favorites I enjoyed were the oysters and cooked scallops. The caviar though I didn\\'t enjoy all that much. They offered only one variety and it was black caviar and it was SALTY. A tad disappointed as \"top of the Mark\" sunday brunch in San Francisco offers a few different kinds of Caviar. The cooked food was also good but I can\\'t go too much into detail as I was filled from 2 full plates of seafood. The Filet Mignon and Prime rib were delicious. Desserts were also absolutely phenomenal! \\n\\nAs for the service, I thought it was alright. My dad noticed that each server took care of 5-6 tables each. The server wasn\\'t THAT attentive in my opinion. Every time I wanted more OJ or champagne, I would have to ask for some more. I also felt like it took a while for the guy to come and clear the table of dirty plates. Very nice guy but could have been more attentive to clearing plates and refilling beverages.\\n\\nOverall, I give Sterlings Sunday Brunch a 4.5-5 stars. The food quality was excellent and service was just alright. However, as we left the ladies ALSO received a rose (well my mom grabbed her own as the greeter guy was MIA and wasn\\'t there when we were leaving, it THAT was a little disappointing). But overall, I was impressed with the food and service was terrible so def. come check it out. MAKE SURE YOU MAKE RESERVATIONS FIRST THOUGH. Enjoy!',\n",

When My boyfriend called to make the appointment the receptionist did a great job of up selling him to the Bellagio facial. I received an email of my itinerary and what was expected as well as am ementities. I arrived an hour early to take advantage of the sauna and steam room. My boyfriend paid first and I was leaving gratuity in cash. They walked me upstairs to the spa where I had to check into another desk. I walked to another desk where the lady walked me to my locker and showed me where everything was and where to wait 10 minutes before my appointment. When it was time for my appointment the same lady walked walked around with a clipboard checking people in and walking in groups to another waiting area down a long hall. This is where the therapists came to retrieve us for our first appointment. The girl was so sweet and communication was great. She walked me into a clean room and told me where to put jewelry,robe, spa shoes. She asked about previous massages and told me what to expect for this one. She started with a welcoming greeting, which I found nice because it allowed you to stop the chatter and really start to relax! She used pressure with her hands over my body ontop of the blanket. She then put a large hot towel over the blanket which was very comforting and pressed it into me. The massage was vey firm. She put a detoxifying mask on my back and almost laid a paper like substance over it for it to be removed with ease. When I got up, I was amazed for how intensive the massage was, the room was spotless. It was truly amazing. She walked me to another waiting area where I waited for my seaweed wrap. I had never had a wrap before, so I didn't know what to expect. The esthetician greeted me and told me how the service would go. She left to undress and I laid the towel she left on top of me. She also started with the welcome greeting and applied the smelly substance over my body. She explained the benefits of a wrap, which I found very appealing. This part gets a little awkward, thank God the shower was in the room. She didn't attempt to get any of the seaweed off. I was made to stand up drenched in mud etc and walk to the shower to get everything off. I ended up taking a full shower to get the sticky/ smelly stuff off. Next onto the facial, it felt like the massage went on forever. I loved the mask that was used and the esthetician was very knowledgeable about products and skincare. She left a nice little bag with products I might enjoy. I was walked back to the locker room by my esthetician and given instructions to go downstairs to the salon/ nail wing of the Bellagio. It was a little awkward waiting in an open waiting room ( being the only one in a robe) while others waited for hair services. The nail tech was extremely friendly and knowledgeable. A very nice pedicure that came with a peach smoothie. Upon leaving gratuity, was a little awkward. Had My boyfriend not paid in advance, I imagine it would have been easier. I had to leave the spa tips upstairs and the nail tip downstairs which a tiny hole in the front of the desk was for leaving them their tips. All in all, I couldn't have expected anything less than the luxurious time spent at The Bellagio Salon and Spa!\",\n",

They just aren\\'t and that\\'s okay...You go to those types of places for the theme, locale, music, etc.  So during a recent visit to Las Vegas, I was pleasantly surprised to have a tasty meal at the House of Blues.   Here\\'s what we had:\\n* Voodoo Shrimp - The house favorite, sautéed jumbo shrimp, simmered in an amber beer reduction on top of housemade jalapeño cornbread.  \\n* Street Tacos - Three street style corn tortillas, green cabbage, fresh pico de gallo, roasted tomatillo salsa, Cotija cheese and avocado lime crème with shrimp; \\n* Applewood Bacon Wrapped Meatloaf - A delicious blend of savory flavors wrapped in applewood bacon and topped with our house made wild mushroom sauce, served with fresh vegetables and Red Rose garlic mashed potatoes; \\n* Jambalaya - Marinated chicken, white rice, andouille sausage, sweet peppers and roasted green onions in a spicy traditional jambalaya sauce\\n\\nI don\\'t know who developed the Voodoo Shrimp recipe, but they were working some magic back in that kitchen.  Moist cornbread with expertly cooked shrimp and a killer sauce.  Woo wee!  I think that I\\'m going start speaking Creole after tasting that dish.  My daughter Muff and one of my nieces asked to have shrimp in their tacos and the kitchen easily obliged.  (That\\'s one advantage of going to a theme restaurant, they aim to please.  No chef driven nonsense where the dish has to remain \"exactly\" how they envisioned it.)  They were gracious enough to share several bites of their tacos and they were tasty.  I actually ordered the meatloaf and I can tell you that my leftovers were great cold the next day. What does that tell you?  It was great hot or cold and that\\'s hard to beat with that yummy mushroom sauce. (I think that there was some form of sausage mixed into the loaf too that gave it an extra special touch.  Yum!) \\n\\n\\nMy sister-in-law ordered the Jambalaya and she wasn\\'t really pleased with it. (I try to avoid Jambalaya if it\\'s not in New Orleans or a kitchen that I trust.)  She said that the tomato flavor was too overpowering and sharp.  My cousin thought the same thing on a prior visit.)  Overall, we had a really tasty meal and I was really surprised.  Additionally, a live band was there at the time and the music was rocking.  Yay us!\\n\\nKitschy, yes!  But enjoyable?  Also, emphatically yes!

I suppose this isn\\'t so much an \"Asian fusion\" restaurant; it merely serves both Chinese and Mexican food \"side-by-side\" as it advertises, which doesn\\'t seem that great, does it? I mean, one side is going to suck, right? \\n\\nAnd it\\'s not that great. Granted, I only tried the Mexican food, but at 13 bucks for some shiu-mai, I\\'m not that much of a sucker. So my friend and I went for the tacos.  I got the barbacoa and was told the mushroom was highly recommended. At 4.50 a pop, I\\'m expecting some high quality stuff.

I love prosciutto and mixed the cantaloupe it was good, but they gave me about 1/2 lb of prosciutto with the pieces of cantaloupe. The plate looked like a bowl of prosciutto and the cantaloupe was buried underneath. Also, i noticed that the \"cook\" attempted to cut the cantaloupe into pieces but stopped midway.. what the hell was that?\\n\\nMy steak was cooked they way i wanted and it was seasoned ok. However, i noticed that one of my dining partners order her steak medium and she instead got it medium rare.. the same color as mine. Whatever.

We came on a Friday night, hoping to get a quick meal in before my boyfriend's basketball game. He had the spinach/cheese stuffed ravioli and I had an alfredo dish. The pasta was cooked very poorly and was very clumpy, it seemed like we could have made better at home. The alfredo seemed very oily, the bacon I had added to it was sparse and lacked flavor, and the ravioli was unappetizing. We also had an order of garlic knots that they forgot about, but once we did get them, they were underwhelming and both the sauce and the bread lacked a lot of flavor. My fiance is normally a garbage disposal when it comes to leftovers, but after packing up most of our food and taking it to-go, we ended up throwing it away the next day. I think this place is still working out some kinks (i.e. the cashier seemed to forget to give a lot of tables their utensils, which the runner had to end up doing). I do appreciate that they make their pasta fresh and they have fresh herbs growing in-house, but nothing about our experience made us want to go back. It looks like the place has a lot of fans though and I'm sure will continue to thrive and improve. \\n\\nGreat concept, but I think I will be sticking to Custom Built Pizza when it comes to my customizable Italian food needs.\",\n",

When we contacted the Loss Prevention Dept. later the following week he informed us that according to their records there had been some activity in our room while we were away. I asked why someone would enter our room when the privacy please sign was hanging on the door. The gentleman I spoke with told me that someone could have removed the sign while passing by and we had no proof that the sign was there. I explained that when my husband and I returned to the room that evening the sign was still on the door. He told me that the person who entered the room had a \"stellar\" reputation and was a long time employee with no complaints. I guess the question is why did they steal my jewelry regardless of weather the sign was on the door or not, which it definitely was. Why would someone enter my room without cleaning it, changing the towels etc. There was no signs that anyone had entered the room other than to take the jewelry box. Since the value of the jewelry was quite expensive they have failed to take any responsibility for the employee responsible... Hopefully LVPD will take some action and find the guilty employee. What a horrible experience!',\n",

My wife and I live in Henderson and we were going to a church meeting in Summerlin. Instead of picking up the pizza's at our typical Henderson pizzerias, we decided to try a place closer to where the meeting was. I got on yelp and found Biaggio's. My wife placed the order online. Our meeting was at 6:30 and we got to Biaggio's at about 6:15.  It turns out they had the order wrong. They only made one pizza and it was the wrong pizza.  We ordered two.  We decided to wait for them to make the two we ordered. We sat down and Biaggio came to the table and immediately offered us drinks on the house. I said no thanks, we are in a hurry.  He then brought out an envelope with a $30 gift card.  We were shocked, this went above and beyond in customer service. A few minutes later, the pizzas we ordered were ready. We went to pay, and he wouldn't let us.  Everything was on the house. Not only did he give us the two pizzas we ordered for free, but also the pizza they mistakingly made, with wings and garlic knots. We couldn't believe it. we have never had better customer service. When we got there we were really annoyed, when we left, it was one of the best restaurant experiences we ever had.  By the way, the food was outstanding. Pizza was great and the garlic knots are out of this world.  Biaggio's is what all restaurants should be - great food and great customer service. We will be back.\",\n",

I ended up with the country Benedict. Pretty much country friend steak just on a biscuit with a side of house potatoes.

It's tender, not fishy, fried outside that crunchy, not soggy. For 2.99 it was huge and I wish I would have gotten a second. The chipotle sauce they put on it gives it a kick that really brings out the flavor. They don't skimp on the cabbage and put it on two corn tortillas that don't break. \\n\\nThe second taco I got was still good, marinated chicken.

Great prices for portions, and I find myself having more food than I can eat. \\n\\nRice and beans taste super fresh, and again I love I watch them make everything and grill it. \\n\\nWhat's new as well is that they changed their salsa bar and now I can't stop raving.

Vegas is considered a foodie destination city but according to foodie sites like Vegas Eater a lot of the gems aren\\'t on the Strip. No1DP obliged, knowing that there was going to be a cab ride to and from the hotel.\\n\\nCONCEPT: The restaurant of chef/sommelier Bank Atcharawan \"the Riesling dude\" (formerly of Lotus of Siam - helped develop the wine list there with focus on Rieslings), who won one of the \"Sommeliers of the Year 2013\" from Food and Wine. While Lotus of Siam\\'s focus is on northern Thai cuisine, Chada Thai is focused on southern Thai cuisine, a region unexplored by many Thai restaurants. Bon Appetit also listed this under its top 50 new restaurants. \\n\\nCAB FARE: ~$13 from the Palazzo. \\n\\nVENUE: Like most Vegas off-strip restaurants, especially in Chinatown, it\\'s located in a nondescript strip mall. The cab almost missed the restaurant as we approached the area where we thought the restaurant was and I had to look through the door to confirm that this was the restaurant. \\n\\nThe inside has a minimalist look. Picture frames were along the wall where I sat. The main focus was on the large wine racks in the wall closest to the entrance to the kitchen. No1DP notes that the main focus would be more on the wine list and food. For a Friday night at 9:30 there were only several groups dining in. \\n\\nSERVICE: Good service, considering they only came by when they thought they were needed and left us alone most of the night. They also made good menu recommendations. While we were eating they also told us that 15 minutes prior to leaving they can call and arrange a cab to pick us up as they noticed that we arrived here via cab. \\n\\nWINES\\nNo1DP: Reuscher-Haart Piesporter Riesling, Mosel, Germany (Riesling, $8). A crisp and slightly sweet Riesling. I normally don\\'t like whites but his wine was better than mine and I seriously considered sharing another glass with him. \\nMe: Bouchard Pere & Fils Bourgogne Pinot Noir, Burgundy, France (Pinot Noir, $8) Light and earthy and made a good sipping red. \\n\\nFOOD: No1DP and I decided to go a la carte.\\nSom Thum Goong Pao ($11) - Green papaya salad topped with grilled prawn. Papayas were crunchy, sweet yet slightly tart. Shrimps were grilled just right and had a slight crunch. \\nYum Kai Nok Kata ($6) - Fried Quail eggs, topped with dry shrimp, cilantro, onion. Spicy lime dressing. Egg was a mixture between poached and over easy. Yolk melted in mouth yet did not leave a mess on the plate. Dried shrimps definitely added a sweet and spicy kick. \\nPad Kee Mao (Drunken Noodle) with Lobster Tail ($21) - Flat rice noodles, hot chili, garlic and basil. Lobster was separated so that the dish can easily be shared. Lobster texture suggests it was cooked just right. More notably the noodles did not have a heavy taste, which meant that it wasn\\'t cooked with TOO much oil. \\nSeabass Tod Krueng ($19) - Pan fried Chilean seabass glazed with chili paste. Fish texture was SOFT and could be separated with a fork. The chili paste gave the fish a kick. No1DP notes that unlike cheap spices, where the spice is sharp and dissipates quickly the spice kick just lingers in your mouth a minute. Right amount of ginger.   \\n\\nMost notably about these particular dishes was that sub-par Thai dishes have a very heavy feeling after you eat them. That was not the case with this restaurant and every dish we had was still quite light. This was a pleasant surprise as we wanted to have room for 3-course dessert afterwards.\\n\\nDefinitely will be back to try out more dishes and to have a crack at Bank\\'s Riesling collection.',\n",

The restaurants are mainly in the middle connecting to both towers and Spiedini Ristorante is a must-try! Just amazing service, food, and always on-point. The views here are also amazing.

We had a friend who knew someone at the door so we paid just to tip the host for comping our cover. It was about 1am when we got there on a Saturday night. Most of the party goers where already inside living it up. There wasnt much of a line out front. We walked in to the club via the side entrance and my first glimpse of Surrender was a nice one. Beautiful outdoor pools, packed dance floor, several bars to choose from and even some gaming tables by the big bar across the pool from the dance floor.\\n\\nAlthough we didn't know it at first step inside but Diplo was the DJ for the night. That explains the big crowd and why the dance floor was so packed. He played good music. Of course it was all edm and the crowd was loving it. He def gets the crowd involved so I'm sure everyone was having a good time. Actually the entire club looked like it was happening, so props to Surrender. It's a nice looking club. Ratio of girls to guys was better than a lot of clubs I've been to in Vegas. So definitely good for us guys to know... ha! Hope to check it out again next time I'm in town.

I was with my friends and my boyfriend just last sunday to eat dinner and we were assigned to this server named Jessica. At first, she was still okay getting our orders until the time that she asked me what i want. Now since my boyfriend and i will be sharing a big streak, i ordered a calamari and she asked me, \"is this your meal?\". WHAT THE HECK! Why would she ask me if that was my meal? That isnt right. Who cares what i wanna order! So i just let it go. My friend ordered a three course meal. The soup came and then the steak. And then she stopped serving us. The mashed potato which should be with the steak never came until we got the attention of another server and this other server got it for us. Jessica never even bothered to check on us if we are ok. As far as i can remember, if you are a server, you need to ask if everything is okay. Now come on! This is an expensive place! We have to pay our money\\'s worth by having a nice meal with a good service. And still, we kept our cool. We looked around for Jessica and she was only serving like 2 tables and it wasnt even a busy night. I called her to ask for another bread. Guess what? It never came. And then the dessert which should be included with the three course meal? NEVER CAME. So we decided to just pay and ask her for our bill. We called her for it and waited and waited... NEVER CAME. This is really a bad service among all the restaurants that i have dined. And this server is not really happy with her job. We have no choice but to talk to the manager. My friend talked to the manager...(too bad, i forgot his name) but he was really nice to us. He kept on apologizing and even gave us a discount and had our dessert as \"to go\". \\n\\nThe food was not something to really rave about. But the mashed potatoes were really good. The steak was tender and good as well. The only complaint i had was the bad server named Jessica so if any of you want to eat at this place in Vegas, please ask for another server if they will give you Jessica. I saw the manager talking to her and yet she never came to our table to apologize. \\n\\nI would still recommend this place for the food... just because the manager was nice.

       "  \"THE GOOD: Its downtown.  If you havent been downtown in a while, its time to go.  \\nThis stay started out great, but lost some steam each day, and ultimately failed.\\nGood check-in, great clerk. Nice room on the 25th floor. Arrived for First Friday, caught the shuttle to the Arts District for the fest.  All good; a bunch o' fun.\\nTHE BAD: Either one or two of the 4 elevators were down the entire stay.  Very long waits to and from the room.  Took the stairs down once but the stairwell dumps you out into the hotel's back alley which is probably not where you want to hang...\\nTHE UGLY: On Sunday night about 1:00am, construction began on the room renovation directly above our room (this would not have been a problem on Friday or Saturday, but Monday morning?, yeah, thats gonna be a problem...)  Could NOT sleep through it.  Called front desk, they said we had to move rooms, so at 1:30am, we shlepped our bags down to the 17th floor to escape the cacophony.  The hotel apologized and comp'd us $50 food/beverage credit for the inconvenience.  Later that morning, we got up, not well rested--oh well, its vegas after all--and ate breakfast at the D Grill (you may want to read the separate review for this place before going), and charged it to the room against the comped credit.  Found out later they never comped the $50 to the room and I got charged for everything.  In the process of discovering this, I found out: The D and Golden Gate will implement a $20/night resort fee as of August 19, 2013, so thats really a nail in the ol' coffin -- er, the ol' Fitzgeralds, er, The D Hotel.\\nGRADE: In this case, lets just let the hotel's name speak for itself: D\",\n",

Everything was in decent shape and functioned properly, but the only thing that impressed me about the room was the push-button shades/sheers (wall mounted, not remote).\\n\\nLOCATION:\\nBellagio\\'s location on the strip is pretty good, but then again, so is Imperial Palace\\'s.  That being said, I didn\\'t leave the property for the extent of my stay; so I guess there\\'s something to be said for the casino.\\n\\nPOOL:\\nThe pool(s) area is pretty large, but nothing exceptional beyond that.  A few of the smaller pools have fountains (these are not heated), but most are just standard, rectangular, 3 or 4 foot deep areas to wade around in.\\n\\nTHE BANK:\\nThe Bank (the nightclub at Bellagio) is nice, a decent size, and has tons of tables if you\\'d like to purchase bottle service.  As a hotel guest, you can get free entry before around 11:30pm.\\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/the-bank-nightclub-las-vegas#hrid:6xl78ZnLe3cPVEI7Nc53rA\\n\\nMICHAEL MINA:\\nMichael Mina\\'s restaurant offers fine dining at a 1 star Michelin rated level.

To have a tapas, asian fusion place in Henderson is pretty cool and with all the cool cats hanging out at the LVAC, I am sure this place will be a \"go-to\" restaurant in the future!\\n\\n1.  Location - 3 star - This is at the 215 and Eastern on the NorthWest corner.  Near the LVAC and in the place that was formerly Xtreme Sushi and Steak.  Very similar upscale and funky interior with a great exterior patio seating.  It was almost warm enough to attempt to sit outside, however we were ill prepared.  There are a variety of tables, booths and plenty of sizing for large or small groups. Love the location, but it is difficult to get to at times due to all the traffic and all.  However, if you can navigate here, you will do well.\\n\\n2  Ambiance - 4 star - As mentioned, plenty of tables and booths.  A small cool bar in the middle as well as a small sushi bar off to the side.  In my two times here, I did not see people really hanging out at either bar, yet when this place get\\'s busier and it will, I am sure it will be hopping. \\n\\n3.  Food - 5 star - The food here is definitely very good, and we have tried so far many of the dishes. \\n\\nLucky Rice - Some concoction of sticky rice perfectly flavored with kim chee, fried egg and bacon.  We added the pork belly option and this is a dish that you will keep on eating and eating.  Tasty and addicting.  The only problem with this dish is slowing down a bit to taste it.  The texture, flavor and taste is just about perfect.  This is something we will eat every time.  We had both the regular Lucky Rice with all the meat and one vegetarian one without meat as it is Lent....\\n\\nLettuce Wraps - They have both the vegetarian and one with chicken.  We ordered the vegetarian and it was great, when we did get it.  It had Mushroom, Daikon, Eggplant and Carrots.  Great flavor and of course fun to eat in the little lettuce wraps that they give to you.\\n\\nShishito Peppers - These were cooked to perfection.  Nice taste, not spicy, just a hint of pepper.  More vegetable but cooked to a nice crispy and charred texture.  Made this so flavorful and mouth watering. Yes, you have to enjoy veggies to like this, and I have had Shishito Peppers at many places and enjoyed it here so much!\\n\\nFor the RobataYaki, we had Chicken and Scallion,  Kabocha Squash, and Maitake Mushrooms  These were all very good, tasty, and served on little platters with the skewered delicacies!\\n\\nFries - Yes, we ordered something as dopey as fries.  It was a Friday, most of us were on \"Lent\" so no meat. We were hungry, and heck the fries looked good.  You know what, as odd as it seems, and I am an Asian Foodie, I really enjoyed the fries and I normally never order fries or eat them!\\n\\nThe Dessert - The Funkler and the SnowBall - Wow, we were about to leave and I was actually yelping for a good dessert place and was about to go to Snowball Shavery all the way in C-Town.  I had a guest here from New York, so we were on an excursion of food before her flight back to the Big Apple that night.  We were about to pay and then one of the other waiters asked us about dessert and we said....What the Heck!\\n\\nThe Funkler - A Chocolate chip Blondie with ice cream and chocolate sauce. The size of a huge slice of pie, we devoured it. The blondie was really great tasting and the ice cream and sauce made this a la mode hunk of chocolate chip was definitely plate licking worthy.\\n\\nThe SnowBall - Yep, those good ole Hostess SnowBalls that I had growing up.  Chocolate cake wrapped in a fluffy marshmallow  and coconut and pink!  So much better tasting than the Hostess one. This has a more dense texture and heavier cake.  Made for an awesome tasting dessert  Came with some kind of ice cream.  I was not sure what it was exactly.\\n\\n4.  Service - 3 star at best - In my two times here, I would say that they service was okay.  First time was lunch they kept servicing us from the far side of our table, over all the condiments and so far away from us.  Very odd.  Second time, we had dinner and it took about 10 minutes for the waiter to come take our drink orders, it took about twenty minutes and two reminders to get our drinks, then when we ordered, he left out two orders and got one of the vegetarian ones, entirely wrong and brought it with meat.  We never got the two other orders, but since I checked the bill and they did not charge me, we didn\\'t ask for them. It was too late and we had a plane to catch.  A good point is that another waiter came out and corrected the vegetarian order and gave us a take home box for the meat order and did not charge us. That was cool.\\n\\nYou are only as strong as your weakest link so I feel that once they get their wait staff fully up to speed, this place will be a solid 4 or 5. On a good note, we had one main server, and three others helping him so I love teamwork!',\n",

By most accounts this is one of the top buffets on the strip, so I figured I couldn't go wrong.\\n\\nThe selection for lunch wasn't that great and quite a few of the items look like they had been sitting out for quite a while.  They didn't seem to be too worried about keeping the items full.   The quality of the food was not terrible.  The fried chicken was pretty good.  The roast beef was too bloody rare.  The sushi and pizza were not edible.  Dry and not fresh at all.  The asian dishes were ok.  I think the only real stand out items were the smoked salmon and fried chicken.  The rest of it was on par with a lesser buffet off the strip.  \\n\\nThey have brunch and lunch together, so they had some breakfast items that weren't bad.  The dessert station was severely lacking.  The highlight was the gelato bar which had about 10 different flavors.  The rest of it was mostly those little cake squares you've seen a million times at every other buffet in the world.  No bread pudding, no pie, no chocolates.

My two tips for the ATVs that I wish I had known: \\n(1) Bring gloves. I got blisters. Still worth it though.\\n(2) Bring a water bottle with a built-in straw.

Since  I was having my car serviced out in Henderson on Saturday, I decided to give this place a try. We arrived at about 9:30am and we had a five minute wait from the time we walked in to sitting down. The hostess that greeted us was really friendly and made us feel welcome. I noticed there was outdoor seating but it was not offered. I suppose I should have asked..... Anyway we sat inside towards the back of the restaurant and it was a good location to watch the action and quiet enough to have conversation. They play some good music but at just the right volume. \\n\\nThe menu is full of some fun and different meals. It was a hard choice to pick just one but I ended up ordering Tacos Huevos and Mom had the Eggs in the Basket. She is not too adventurous when it comes to breakfast but her meal was still a good choice. She ordered coffee with her meal and the coffee cups are huge. For those coffee drinkers out there, you won't be disappointed as you can get your caffeine on with these cups! They also offer all kinds of flavored mimosas from your basic orange to guava. I enjoyed the peach which was more like a Bellini but great way to start the morning. \\n\\nThe food arrived and the presentation was nice. There were three tacos with potatoes, eggs, chili's, avocados and crema on top. The salsa on the side had a nice kick and complimented the mini tacos. Three tacos was the right amount to serve as one more would have been too much. The Eggs in the Basket came with wheat toast and the egg was right in the middle of the toast with two strips of bacon on top and a little slaw. \\n\\nOur service was very good and the decor is a touch of modern and homey. When you first walk in there is a mini bakery with fresh muffins, monkey bread, and other assorted breads for sale. Everyone that works there seems to be very friendly and cool. I accidentally spilled my Moms coffee and it was cleaned up very quickly. Only one draw back, there is only one bathroom which when the place gets busy means you gotta wait so watch how many of those mimosas you drink (Ha! Ha!). \\n\\nWe left about 11:00, and there was a wait at this time with lots of people sitting outside enjoying the beautiful morning. This place is pretty easy to find, you just have to be careful not to pass it when you reach the light at Horizon Ridge Parkway. It is in a strip mall and on the corner.\\n\\nI definitely plan to return again so I can have the chilaquiles next time!\",\n",

       "  \"The fellas and I were looking for a quick dinner option before hitting the club this particular night. Luckily, after walking to the exit and realizing it was pouring outside, we turned around and noticed Holsteins across the hall from the Marquee. \\n\\nFirst and foremost, the service was friendly and the staff did a great job. Secondly, the food was well worth it. \\n\\nTo start, they bring out seasoned popcorn that was quickly devoured by us. Next I ordered the Frozen Grasshopper (a Bam-Boozled Shake) that consisted of Peppermint, Chocolate, Crème De Menthe, Van Gogh Chocolate Vodka. While it was good, it was definitely a lot (couldn't finish it after the burger). \\n\\nAnd lastly, their burger. My, what a burger! After being torn between the Gold Standard & Fun-Ghi Big Buns, I decided to go with the Gold Standard. Now this burger is as follows: Dry Aged Beef Sirloin Burger With Smoked Bacon, Aged Goat Cheddar Cheese, Tomato Confit, Baby Arugula & Garlic-Chive Aioli. I ordered mine medium and it was plated as such. The sirloin was cooked to perfection with a beautiful char outside and juicy inside. The smoked bacon and aged goat cheddar gave it a great kick, but for me, the magic came in the garlic-chive aioli. I mean, WOW, what a burger! \\n\\nEvery bite was tasteful, satisfying, and worth every penny. It was easily one of the best burgers I've ever had. All the ingredients played beautifully with one another, and came together to form a great experience. \\n\\nWill remain a favorite in Vegas and one I MUST revisit whenever I'm in town. So should you.\",\n",

Obviously I chose this restaurant due to a yelp search, yet it was the garlic bread pictures that won me over was looking for something traditional versus garlic knots. Only ordered a glass of malbec wine $10 and a house salad $8 and Arancini $8. Food came out quickly, literally 5 minutes. Yet I didn't receive my complimentary garlic bread for a bit, asked a waiter about it and then got it. Salad was very good and fresh tasting, not even a huge fan of tomatoes yet they were very ripe. The House Italian dressing was very tasty. The garlic bread was definitely just what I wanted, very buttery and tons of garlic on it. Can never have too much garlic in my opinion. The Arancini was flavorful but I do think maybe it could have  been a little warmer/hotter, and possibly deep fried just a touch more so that when they are laid over the tomato sauce they wont get soggy as quickly. They were slightly breaking open due to them absorbing the tomato sauce liquid. The server suggested a Malbec wine, it was indeed a very good choice.

       "  'Once upon a time, in Las Vegas, NV, a couple booked a well-deserved vacation to Cancun, Mexico for their fifth wedding anniversary.  The trip was paid for with their hard earned money, they even splurged for good seats on Spirit Airlines for their trip.  They arrived at Las Vegas McCarran International Airport with all of their necessary documentation and even printed their boarding passes at home to avoid unnecessary charges at the airport.  They even made sure their luggage was not over the required forty (40) pounds per bag as required by Spirit Airlines.  All went well.  The flight departed as scheduled, and they were off to a glorious vacation!\\nWhen they arrived at Detroit Airport, they only had forty (40) minutes until their connecting flight to Cancun, Mexico.  That was no problem, because the flight even landed a little bit early, and the gate they were departing from was very close.  When they deplaned, it was discovered that the flight to Cancun had been delayed for three hours.  Not a problem, it would give them time to eat a bite before their flight.  After about an hour, they checked the departing flight board and to their surprise, the Cancun flight had been CANCELLED!  When they asked a Spirit Airlines employee what the issue was, the employee rudely responded with, \"Go downstairs to baggage claim and they will re-book you.\"\\nThey went downstairs to baggage claim and were greeted by an exceptionally long line of one hundred and fifty (150) people, waiting to be re-booked.  During their wait, they were never told what exactly happened to our flight except that there were \"mechanical problems.\"  They assumed the plane was broken, so they continued to wait in line for FOUR HOURS, while TWO people were handling the re-booking of the one hundred and fifty (150) passengers.  They were offered no water, no snacks, and no explanation regarding anything.  After the long wait, they were put on another airline to complete their trip, but not until the NEXT DAY.  \\nEven though Spirit Airlines paid for their hotel and gave them meal vouchers, they still lost a night in fabulous Cancun, Mexico which cost approximately $450.00 and plenty of happiness.  They later found out that the flight was cancelled due to a \"crew issue.\"  Lie #1 from Spirit Airlines.\\rThe next day, the couple continued their trip to Cancun, Mexico on American Airlines (which they also had to pay $50.00 for their luggage) and arrived without issue.  Their vacation was fabulous, but like all good things, it came to an end.  The couple arrived at Cancun Airport and boarded Spirit Airlines flight number NK-240 to Ft. Lauderdale to catch flight NK-777 back to Las Vegas, Nevada.  The flight went well, and they even landed a bit early in Ft. Lauderdale.  Suddenly, a flight attendant came on the loud speaker to tell them that they had to hold the passengers on the plane for twenty (20) minutes because customs was backed up.  This wasn\\'t a huge deal at first, as the connecting flight to Las Vegas wasn\\'t for an hour and forty minutes.  Little did they know, Spirit Airlines had a glitch in their computers and reported that there were ten (10) American citizens on that flight instead of the one hundred and ninety (190) that were actually on the aircraft.  The couple ended up missing the connecting flight to Las Vegas.  Distraught, they went to the Spirit Airlines desk and were told they could only book them on a flight the NEXT DAY, which wouldn\\'t get them home until 5:00 p.m.  This particular couple has to work for a living (hence the mention of hard earned money in the first paragraph) and they needed some time to get their life back in order to return to work Monday morning.  This option was not acceptable and they asked for a refund.  The customer service agent stated she would refund this leg of the trip and it would take seven (7) to ten (10) business days to receive.  They called a family member in Las Vegas and found an American Airlines flight leaving early the next morning and would get them to Las Vegas at noon on June 18, a day later than anticipated.\\rThe couple was then burdened with finding a hotel room in Ft. Lauderdale, which Spirit stated they would not help with because the delay was, \"Not their fault.\"  Lie #2 from Spirit.  I know this because a recently received email from their customer service department stated they missed their flight due to \"inclement weather.\"  We all know this is another LIE.  Lie #3 from Spirit. \\rThe couple found a hotel that had a shuttle and were able to get a few hours of sleep before flying to Las Vegas the next day.  \\rThis concludes my story about the vacation the couple experienced.',\n",

After waiting a lengthy time at the registration counter, we finally got settled into our room. Less than an hour later, we find a bed bug!!!!!!!!!

However, $24.99 AYCE does provide decent value.\\n\\nTheir popular chicken wings done Thai, Japanese or Korean style remain unchanged, are still great, and a must order.  \"Uni Scrambled Egg\" with a side of toast and topped with caviar was also a nice treat that entered the realm of luxurious breakfastness.  And in no surprise to anyone that knows me, I enjoyed everything that had to do with pork belly.    \\n\\nThrowing some \"wow\" factor into the mix, the initial order of 20 skewers brought out on a long wooden board was definitely that.  The 3 foot \"signature king skewer\" for a ridiculously low price of $3.99 consisting of flap, chicken thigh, pork belly and garlic sirloin is worth at least one order just for the slightly comical presentation.  I disliked that I was put to work in carving the meat and distributing it to my tablemates, but at least there\\'s now concrete evidence that I would be the worst employee in the history of Brazilian steakhouses.  \\n\\nBiggest minuses were the eggplant skewers being served raw and unquestionably the worst chicken skin yakitori I\\'ve ever had.

I seriously miss all the delicious fish and chalkboard specials they used to have and would be happy to pay extra for those items if still available.     \\n\\nDespite those negatives, Kushiyaki Inyo is worth considering throwing into the rotation of AYCE when you\\'ve had your fill of sushi and KBBQ.

From the superb coaches to enthusiastic colleagues who were very supportive and inspiring, nothing compares with my RA experience. \\n\\nWhat I love the most about Rachell Allen is that it does\\n not only prepare you mentally (lectures & tests) and physically (you can do it, I can do it, we can do it drills) but it also makes sure you have that focus and confidence, hence uplifting your spirit.\\n\\nThe tools I used were RACHELL ALLEN NOTES, LaCharity\\'s Prioritization, Delegation and Assignment book and UWorld. I reviewed the notes with all my heart. The low scores I\\'d been getting from the practice tests made me thirst for more knowledge so I read the rationales passionately, referred to our notes and re-took them until I master them. I have a job in the morning until 8 in the evening so I studied from 9pm to dawn. During my days off, I would go to the library from the time it opens to the time it closes. I also sacrificed hanging out with friends because I had to. Yes, it is challenging but then hard work always pays off so you have to love what you do. And when I felt like being pressured and exhausted, I would drive to the beach and wait for the sunset. It\\'s a good form of relaxation! Try it!\\n\\nFailure is never an option. I took the NCLEX for the second time on September 14th. The moment I sat down on that pretty chair, I hid the time and question number on my screen because I wanted to stay focused on the test and nothing else. I wrote on my board the magic word \"REFOCUS\" and asked God for wisdom and guidance. I told myself that I would just take my time in answering every single question as if I was savoring my favorite meal. It doesn\\'t matter how slow you go for as long you do not give up.\\n\\nFrom Vegas back in April 2016 where I first attended the class to Ontario in July, the coaches were just absolutely amazing! To Dra. Rosemarie Pica, Sir Ryan De Leon and Miss Jennie Anne Opilla, I am forever grateful for all the classroom learnings and life\\'s lessons you have shared to each one of us. It always feels great to be surrounded by positive people. Indeed, you guys are heaven-sent. I must say, RA (Rachell Allen) leads to RN! Here\\'s a snappy salute! \\n\\nTo God be all the Glory!',\n",

Otherwise, you'll just essentially be paying too much for one buffet. Have 3 or 4 sane meals and a dessert break. \\n5) Focus on what buffet's do well: breakfast, dessert, crab, fresh batches and the odd diamond in the rough.\\n\\nI think the confusion with whether the food is good or not comes from the point of reference. Las Vegas buffets take every other buffet to the tool shed. However, they will never challenge the quality of good restaurants and good home cooking, at least except for the flan at Paris (OMFG that was good). I am a skilled home cook and have eaten at plenty of fine restaurants. I still enjoy the buffet because having just one or two bites of so many different things is fun and as long as you play to the buffet's strengths, the food is good.\\n\\nIronically, the 24 hour buffet isn't a great value in terms of quantity. If you are looking for fuel for the money, you'll be better off buying just one buffet per day, preferably breakfast. I'm a camel so I do fine eating a ton once a day but I suspect lots of people could do fine with a big breakfast and an evening snack.\\n\\nThe value is liberty and food security.

Just a refresher for those who don't know, I love my house made juices because I can get specific to my taste and I'm a max VG vaper. They don't carry house juice, but they have up to 90/10 max VG here. You can try their juices in their prepped tanks, or for you drippers out there like me, they have drip samples as well. No aggressive sales tactics, in fact we there is no pressure at all. This is how all B&M shops should be. The crew there is awesome. I watch as customers were getting educated on products and others left satisfied with their purchases. \\n\\nDefinitely coming back here. Well worth a check out if you like premium juices.

       "  'Before heading down to Trader Joe\\'s, I came here for a quick pick me up. I needed some more fuel to finish my Christmas shopping and all I could think of.. was Baja Fresh! \\n\\nThis location is tucked in a corner behind Jack in a Box. Same complex side of Fedex, but further down. I walked in and was greeted by the cashier. I enjoy such vibrant lighting and it\\'s really all from natural sunlight shining through to the inside. The whole place looked nice and all the stations from the drinks to the salsa bar was clean and well presented. I ordered the Baja Chicken and brought my refill \"to-go\" cup to use for 99 cents. It\\'s so useful and I like the idea that I\\'m saving a cup every time I use it. :D Plus I refill it again before I head out, so I can replenish myself whenever I need it. It\\'s definitely a win-win situation. I even brought half of my sweetened green tea home and put in the fridge for later and it was still so refreshing to drink it. Almost like a cold dessert! I also used a previous receipt survey coupon that gives me $2 off from spending $8. All you have to do to get this is go online and complete a quick survey on your dining experience. Then you are given a code at the end, which you use toward your next purchase. This can be done every time you dine there. Sweet deal right?!??! I like it A lot.\\n\\nI went to the restroom to wash my hands after ordering and it was spotless clean. The salsa bar is the first thing I checkout and this time there was a new salsa of the season.... Cranberry Salsa!!! It had diced celery, onion, cranberry, and bits of cilantro.   When my order was ready, I cut the Baja Chicken Burrito in half and put some of this new salsa on top... took the first bite and the flavors exploded with freshness. It seriously had this perfect combination of a healthy meal. You start to understand why  their philosophy is \"Live Fresh.\" The more I ate this scrumptious burrito, the more I tasted all the high quality ingredients and freshness from it. The soft flour tortilla tasted so delicious from having it slightly grilled and it\\'s almost like they brushed it with rich light butter. It\\'s like eating a butter cookie without all the sugar added to it. However they grilled this burrito, it tasted oh so yummy! The Cranberry Salsa gives this burrito the ultimate whammy of renewed vows of love. Eating this together and you have the Burrito of a Lifetime. I swear I went by to the salsa bar over six times to refill my cup!!! And it\\'s not because I was a few steps away, but it was that good to keep going back for more. Simply the best tasting, healthy burrito I have devoured. I even licked my fingers to taste the salsa that was dripping down the burrito from over pouring. Can you imagine how fun this experience was?!! Keep imagining... Until you get down and dirty like me.. you really don\\'t know what fun is at Baja Fresh. But you know it\\'s good when it\\'s messy and you don\\'t even care. I even added a chunk of cilantro in the Cranberry Salsa and it was a swimming beautiful, green garden in that sauce. I am a Huge fan!!!\\n\\nEven their complimentary tortilla chips were served in a paper bag and it wasn\\'t even oily at all! No oil stain whatsoever on the paper bag and that\\'s so great to see. Even the chips taste healthy and good!!! \\n\\nOn their site, it\\'s noted that all of their entrées are made with all natural, hormone free, fire-grilled Chicken, Steak, and slow-roasted Carnitas. And they serve only fresh guacamole and famous salsas made with locally grown, farm fresh produce!!! \\n\\nAfter I ate everything.. I felt like I could conquer the world!!! Energized and ready to get my shopping on. I was feeling so Alive and recharged! \\n\\nI\\'m having a real addiction to their fresh produce and you can tell that everything is made by hand. You know where I\\'ll be on my day off.... spending a night here! :P',\n",

Parking was plenty since it was located in a large shopping center.  Another bonus is there was no wait. This place is good for small or large parties. The staff was attentive and served your drink right away. They came right afterwards to take your order and the food came out in a timely manner too.  The ave price for a bowl of pho is around $7. A little bit pricy since back at Sgv, you can get a bowl for $5-6. \\n\\nI ordered the meatball pho $6.95 while my bf ordered the pho tai (rare steak) $6.95. I have to admit, they will give you tons of meatballs. I felt like they served more meatballs than rice noodles. The meatballs were also good sizes. You would think I would have have a better review but what my bowl lacked was the temperature. I felt like my soup was lukewarm. I can handle hot soup, so this was just so disappointment. I come to have pho because of the hot soup... Not to have more meatballs and noodles. The soup did have flavorful but it just wasn't hot enough.  They did come out with a large plate of limes, bean sprouts, basils, and jalapeños. \\n\\nWould I come back, yeah I would. But I will pray my soup will be hot the next time around.\",\n",

I used to love the Flamingo.\\n\\nOur room was dirty beyond belief: lime scale all over the showerhead (the showerhead ring was hanging off of the wall), a dirty torn shower curtain, a filthy black hole full of dust and grime where the bathroom vent used to be, dust all over the lamps and in the corners of the room, AND our room wasn\\'t cleaned ONCE during our stay despite requesting it from the front desk AND the cleaning staff.  Strange, because there were people cleaning rooms on our floor.  Just not ours, apparently.  \\n\\nAdditionally, the closet door was broken and one of the outlets had been pushed through the drywall.  Some of the lamps and the clock had been unplugged so we had to do a little work to figure out which outlet was connected to the wall switch so that the clock would work properly.  The TV and a bunch of other things were plugged into a power strip that was shoved into a corner but still fully visible. Classy.\\n\\nNONE of the speed-dial buttons on our phone worked except for room service (Eventually we were told, \"Yeah, they don\\'t work. Just dial 0.\")  which is funny because we didn\\'t have a room service menu and had to ask the hotel (on the phone and in person) for one THREE TIMES (over the course of a full day) before they sent one up.\\n\\nThe hallways outside our room were grimy: filthy stained carpets full of old gum, with bubbles and rolls where they\\'d gotten stretched out from so much use.\\n\\nThe elevator doors don\\'t always open (or close) properly. Scary.  Plus, when you push the button for your floor, the light doesn\\'t light.  Oh wait, yes it does but only on the OTHER side of the car.  What?\\n\\nThe once beautiful flamingo pool and grounds of yore have been mostly removed and replaced with additional buildings and parking.  Instead there is a horrid \"day club\" pool full of wasted 20-somethings listening to earsplitting crappy music.  The kiddie pool is a little better but its not really separated from the \"Go\" pool so after 10 am it sucks too.\\n\\nLest you think I\\'m just being bitchy, we requested a room change on day two and were told that it could take up to six hours between checking out of one room and receiving another.  Um.  No.  We were very up-front with the management and received a small amount of compensation but the number of people I had to talk to get anything done was just insane and at the end of it, the compensation I was promised was not what was delivered.  Sigh.\\n\\nClearly whoever owns this property is waiting for it to die so that they can put a giant fake-fancy \"luxury\" hotel in its place.\\n\\nIt\\'s really too bad. The Flamingo used to be great.\\n\\nPS:  The one really good thing about the property is the Center Cut Steak House and bar.  We had a really great meal in the restaurant with excellent service.  Brent at the bar is an actual real bartender (not a typical casino beer slinger) and makes truly delicious drinks while serving up great conversation.',\n",

It's not OWNED or operated by TAWA, the company that owns the 99 Ranch Supermarkets in CA, WA, etc and T&T Supermarkets in Canada.  This Las Vegas market is a licensee, so it's not at all what you're used to...\\n\\nBu Hau...\",\n",

The receptionist/guy in the front did not say any of this when we entered and though I asked for a couples massage, I was under the impression that we keep our clothes on because it was one of those chinese reflexology massages in a chair/mat.  This was not the case, they asked my boyfriend to take off his shirt and for me to take off my dress, I said no.  My boyfriend was given a hot stones massage unbeknowst to him and was startled by the heat.

Everything else (food) etc cannot comment on, but having a manager disrespect our whole group was enough to think this place is not worth it. Please read to avoid a similar horrible experience. \\n\\nHad a beyond horrible experience here. Came to watch an NCAA game this past Saturday with a group of 5. We got there and the service was horrible. We basically served ourselves by going to the bar to get drinks. The waitress didn\\'t start paying attention to us until she realized we were ordering a lot of drinks and would have a big bill. \\nHere comes the fun part! Someone on my team got hurt and was on the floor. The opposing team\\'s fans at the bar yelled stay down to a kid! So of course I said that\\'s rude and they proceeded to start a chant calling me an \"ahole\". Fine I let that one go. Towards the end of the game when the other team clearly was about to win the same fans started the \"ahole\" chant again for no reason. So I asked the manager if he was going to let that happen at his bar and he said \"this is a sports game, get over it.\" I said ok I understand that but are you still going to accept this kind of behavior and bad environment at your bar? And he said yes. So I left the bar. My friends went to go talk to him and he said rudely \"you don\\'t talk, I\\'m talking.\" Who says that as a manager? His demeanor in handling this situation was rude and demeaning.  I get that it\\'s a sports game, but he should not one that kind of environment at his bar or treated customers that way. I don\\'t know what his problem is but I did complain to upper management and I hope they will handle the situation accordingly. \\nUpper management was very gracious when I told them my situation and I appreciated that. As for bar management HORRIBLE! I don\\'t know how he got this gig as a manager.  As an FYI it was an older man that was the manager on duty for this instance. He could care less about customers and only cared about himself.  No respect for other human beings what so ever. \\nSo if you want to watch sports somewhere where they actually care and respect you as a customer, do not go here. I\\'m sorry to say this after speaking to upper management but other customers deserve to know what a bad environment this is.',\n",

Always ask the hotel/casino employees for the best places, they will know what\\'s good, inexpensive, etc.  My wife and I are staying at Caesars, many many choices of dining to choose from, most of them probably going to ding you at least $100 per person, so we tried this hole in the wall on W Sahara, about a $15 cab ride from our hotel.  Older building and decor, sort of a Victorian style, very dark - you get a distinct \\'60\\'s feel in there.  Their dinner menu features many $50+ steaks, however they run a \"happy hour\" from 5pm-8pm, where most of the entrees are discounted 50% - my $42  14oz. NY Strip was $21, my wife had the 9oz. filet for $26 (menu price $52), and so on.  We had Little neck clams as an appetizer - $12.  Cocktails were reasonable, my wife\\'s Manhattan was $11, my Grey Goose vodka was $13, and the first time I\\'ve ever seen this - was charged $1.95 for a \"large ice cube\".  The drink was great, I didn\\'t complain, but I haven\\'t seen a charge for an ice cube before.  Steaks were cooked to perfection and were excellent.  We noticed there were no salt and pepper shakers on any of the tables, I think their philosophy is that you\\'re not going to need to doctor your steak in any way - in our case that was 100% correct, they were great!  Sides come with your entree, we opted for the Smashed Whiskey Potatoes (yum) and the Garlicky Spinach (also yum).  We were full, but had to try their signature Doughnuts (see photo), home made and decadent.  We got out of there paying a $114 check, which was not bad considering 3 cocktails (including my $1.95 ice cube), an appetizer, entrees and dessert!

We went for a family event that took place back in February, specifically Valentine's weekend and the prices were hiked up so far that the Silverton was our only option.

Unfortunately, the rooms we resided in for those 3 nights that cost us just over $300 per room was horrible.\\n\\nThe rooms don't look like they appear on their website.

The flat screen TV's you see on the website are no where to be found, as we had old tube TV's. In our room, the floor had a this huge hole and the carpet was rolled over it as if that makes the hole just magically fill up and disappear. There was water damage on the ceiling and all along the top of one side of a wall that lead down to the windows, leaving large stains on the curtains. The curtains were also STUCK OPEN so we had a huge parking structure light glaring in our faces at night. The lamp would work when it wanted to, and the refrigerator barely kept water cold.  The shower?..hardly ANY water pressure. The walls are so paper thin that my aunt could hear my cousin and I talking about something from 4 doors away as she was turning the corner to come to our room. The elevator is also lacking in speed. My cousin timed 6 minutes for a frickin elevator to take her down THREE stories...\\n\\nYou guys need to get it together and fix the rooms, not just a few and advertise them on your website, especially if you're going to hike the prices to being $100 a night on a busy weekend, even when you're OFF the strip.  I know for a fact that I'll never stay here again, and neither will the rest of my family.\",\n",

       "  'My posts are generally witty and of a fun nature, unfortunately this one is of a serious nature to me cause these scam artist almost took us for a ride. \\n\\nWhile I could go into detail I won\\'t bother to overload yelp with my story. In a nut shell they came, they briefly saw, they then quoted me $4600 in work while ONLY taking the quickest look at my clogged drain you can imagine. Stating my pipes were \"really old\", needed to be replaced and a day and a half digging was necessary which would run $3250 to dig up the pipes and $1355 to flush my whole house pipe system. Here\\'s the kicker the work would not be warranted due to the fact they couldn\\'t tell the \"integrity\" of my pipes cause of the \"age\" of my house. Okay!? \\n\\nSo in better judgment I get a second opinion. And viola my second opinion, that I found online while researching drain cleaning, came same day and completely fixed my clogged drain for $655 all without digging anything up and without charging me a  and leg. Here\\'s the best part, they ran a camera from my house to the main pipe, from the main pipe to the sewer, only to tell us our plumbing is only 10 years old which is considerably new and updated being that our house was built in 1949. So as for Mr. rooter stating my piping was old etc. just goes to show how far they are willing to go to get their over priced scam job done. \\n\\nPlease contact me via private message I will gladly give you my plumbers info if you are in the Las Vegas area. \\n\\nEnd note Mr. rooter does a scam where no matter what the issue is with your drain system they recommend a camera to be placed through your pipe for $200. Once you agree They tell you the manager is on his way with the camera but what he really is a sales man. He comes and he will then sell, sell, sell, giving you outrageous price rates. It\\'s pretty genius of them to pose as a supervisor on his way for your best interest,  but in reality it\\'s a sales man there to financially rape you. They got me, I agreed and he put the camera in for all of 2 seconds only to tell me my pipes were full of water (DUUUHH) he couldn\\'t see anything but he\\'ll take the $200 off the $4600 cost and put it towards repair.

       "  \"If you like good old fashioned southern food, then Cracker Barrel is the place for you. They have a huge menu, big portions, great prices, friendly service, and tasty food, which is pretty much all the points a restaurant needs to get for a great review in my book.\\n\\nThis was the first time I have been to this Cracker Barrel, and all my other experience with Cracker Barrel's has been in Arizona. It was pretty much exactly like the one I have been to before, with rocking chairs on the patio area (no outdoor dining, just to wait) and a shop full of country style knick-knacks in front of the dining area. They also sell some off brand soda's and candy.\\n\\nThe menu here is one of the biggest I have ever seen at any restaurant, to the point that they even have a huge list of side dishes (well over 20). We had Lisa for our server, and I swear she gave the best menu rundown I have ever heard. She knew everything and could answer any question, and was just one of the friendliest servers we have ever had.\\n\\nEntrees range from $8 to $12, and they are all southern style. They are known for their chicken and dumplings, chicken fried steak and ham, among other things. I love that they have a dinner sampler, which comes with ham, meatloaf and chicken & dumplings. As a person that loves trying different things, this is a meal for me! The chicken and dumplings is probably the best of the items I named above, as it is juicy and soaked in a delicious gravy. The ham and meatloaf were also very good, though nothing that special.\\n\\nMost of the dishes come with your choice of two or three sides, which as mentioned above they have a large variety to choose from. Heck, they even have sides you can only get on certain days of the week. I got the fried okra, hash brown casserole, and turnip greens. All the sides taste great and I want to go back and try them all.\\n\\nIn addition, the meals come with corn bread muffins and biscuits. The corn bread is on the savory side, and I prefer sweet corn bread, but if you like it saltier you will probably enjoy it. I love the biscuits and I suggest you get a side of apple butter to go with them.\\n\\nI've been to Cracker Barrel's before for breakfast, and they do a great job on that to. Just like the huge portions at dinner, their breakfast are big to. They have a breakfast sampler with ham, bacon, sausage, eggs, biscuits, grits, hash browns and gravy for around $10. You just cant beat that variety and size for the price. They also have great pancakes and French toast if you have a morning sweet tooth.\\n\\nMy only real criticism here is that some of the food is a little on the bland side for my pallet, but then again I'm one of those people that loves heavily spiced food, so that is largely a personal preference issue. I have also been told that this Cracker Barrel often has large wait times, though we got right in the night we came, and we were a party of five.\\n\\nThe biggest compliment I can give to the Cracker Barrel is that everything here taste home made. It reminds me of my grandmother's cooking, who is from Arkansas and knows here southern food. Actually my grandmother was with us when we came here and she loved everything about it.\\n\\nIf you want a large southern style meal that taste like it came out of someone's home kitchen, then bring your appetite and stop by here. I'm not usually big on chain restaurants, but Cracker Barrel just get's everything right. I look forward to coming here for some comfort food again.\",\n",

However, I must say he was nice as all the staff at Bouchon were friendly.\\n\\nFor starters, we ordered the clams (it was one of the specials) and a order of the mussels. I've only eaten mussels served hot, but the mussels at Bouchon were served cold. There were about two dozen mussles served on ice. It's the first time I ate mussels cold. It was yummy. I think all the girls enjoyed their entrees. I ordered their special that day which was pan seared scallops. It came in four pieces with a side of asparagus with an orange dressing. On the plate it didn't look like it was a lot of food, but it was very filling. \\n\\nAlthough all of us were stuffed, we managed to squeeze in dessert. We ordered a special they had that day and they threwn in 5 extra dishes: one of which was a lemon tart. I think it's because they knew we were celebrating our friend's bachelorette. \\n\\nI would definitely go to Bouchon again the next time I'm in Sin City.\",\n",

I have been going to Kim for manicures and pedicures for about 3 years now and even though this salon is a good trek from my side of town it is more than worth the drive. Kim is an awesome and talented nail tech and the most fabulous thing about her is that she loves her clients and is more than happy to accommodate their requests. I always leave the salon happy.\\n\\nThe salon has a huge selection of gel and hard gel colors and glitters. I was a pink & white girl for years and finally made the switch to gel. It might not be for everyone but it's the best thing I ever did for my nails.

We all loved french bistro, so we went to Comme Ça, Mon Ami Gobi for the first two nights and decided to try something different off the strip. I read lots good review about this place on yelp and decided to give it a try. It took us almost 40 mins from Henderson to Summerlin. First impression of this place to me was really nice. We all loved the outdoor patio seating area with some kind of view of lake. Our waitress was friendly and menu price was quiet good compared to strip price. We ordered saffron seafood bisque and escargots persillad for appetizers, Poulet Frites, kobe beef hot-dog for entrees, CRÈME BRULEE A LA VANILLE, and GRAND MARNIER CHOCOLATE CAKE for deserts. The only dish I liked was saffron seafood bisque. Kobe beef hot-dog tasted nothing special to me. The sauce of my pan seared chicken breast was tasty but chicken skin was way too salty. All the french fries came with entrees were really salty. you could see sea salt all over the fries and plate!! And dish disappointed me the most was escargot. Escargot is always on my must order list whenever I dine in french restaurants. This is WORST ESCARGOT I ever tasted in my life!!!! I tasted one bite and asked waitress to bring back to kitchen. I asked waitress to ask chef to try the dish and see how chef thinks. Our waitress replied chef said this is exactly how we serve this dish everyday. Really!!!!!!? well, if this is true, then I have to repeat what I just said earlier \" This is WORST ESCARGOT I ever tasted in my life!!!!\" I wonder if there was any kitchen staff spilled salt bottle located next to our escargots and fries!! I am not a complainer if you read all my other reviews on yelp. I am actually very generously with giving stars. But the reply from chef was really making me upset. In the end, manager took off one saffron soup and escargot from our check without lots apologies. Our waitress was a nice lady. She did feel bad that we didn\\'t enjoy our meal. At least she showed she cared on her face not like the manager. I will keep my business in Comme Ça, Mon Ami Gobi and Bouchon and never come back again.',\n",

I'm not normally a Brussels sprouts fan so I was wary when they were recommended.  Glad I choose to get them they were awesome. Next I had a chicken burrito. It was very good, just flat out a good burrito.  For dessert I had three things with my group. We had the cheesecake, excellent crust and a good taste throughout, also the pineapple upside down cake was very good as well.  Finally on a hunch I order pop tarts which are not on the dessert menu.  All I can say is that you have to try them, very unique and very good.  Overall a great experience, I will be back!!!\",\n",

We decided to escape the strip and try downtown ended up at the Nugget as it seemed to be the shining ship in the middle of an armpit area.  \\n\\nThe buffet was reasonable for a large hotel mid-week: $17.99, and while it wasn't over the top, the food was top notch and delicious.  Sushi was just out of the water fresh and the roast beef tasty and perfect.    \\n\\nThe casino had all the familiar offerings, minus one or two state of the art computerized money-takers.  Table minimums were very affordable ($10 min blackjack, $5 min roulette), and they didn't take all our money in the first 5 minutes.  Now I don't ever expect to get rich gambling, but there are some casinos that you basically just hand them your money and within minutes are either walking away or digging in your wallet again.  Myself, I just like to be entertained for a while, some winning combined with some losing, and at best break even when I'm ready to go back to my room or a bar.  The tables at the Nugget did just that - some YEAH!s and some OH NO!s, and in the end not losing much at all.\",\n",

The girl said yes, no problem they are right on the other side of the airport and they will even watch our luggage.  I was thrilled so I bought the tickets for Christmas. When I called a week prior, I was told they only had me for a 6:15 reservation and that they couldn't guarantee anything, but I could always go another night. I was really upset, because that was really the only night we had free. I decided to go with the flow and when we got to the airport we took a cab (its around the corner so you cannot just walk there) and that was about $10 for 2 people. We arrived at 6:15 (thankfully our flight arrived 10 minutes early) and the girl at the front was super helpful. I was at ease. She put our luggage in a separate room and offered us champagne or coffee. We had about a 15 minute wait and we were off to the helicopter. I've done a few other tours and BY FAR this was the nicest helicopter I've ever been in. The ride was smooth and AWESOME. I liked it and he had a BLAST. It was short, 15 minutes but you see everything perfectly. I recommend sitting on the left behind the pilot for the best views or up front with him. It was a really great experience and I would do it again! Just be aware that they tell EVERYONE 6:00 and to arrive at 5:30, so first come first serve flights until everyone is done. They also gave us a free ride to our hotel after :0)\",\n",

We have always been happy with the customer service and assistance at this store.  We went in the other day to finally change plans.  Along with our son and my 90 yr. old father we were all going to join the new \"Unlimited Plan.  We were nicely greeted and our name taken.  2 people were being helped, and 2 were waiting.  Shouldn\\'t have been a long wait.  After about 45 min. and 8 text messages that said \"You are next in line\", and watching workers gathered at the counter socializing while customers were waiting, the greeter could see that we were visibly getting irritated.  I was beginning to think that this location was NO LONGER a Verizon store, but what they call a \"Premium Retailer\" ( which we absolutely would stay from, after several Bad experiences.)  We finally got help from Lauren, who was brought out of the back room to help us.  When we explained what we wanted to do, her reply was no problem, it will only take minutes.  Over 3 hours later, we were sent out the door with with a piece of paper from Lauren that states...CALL CUSTOMER CARE ON THE 29TH OF APRIL, AND LET THEM KNOW YOU ARE ON THE UNLIMITED PLAN .  She went on to state that you can only change your plan at the end of billing cycle, and that wasn\\'t until the 29th.  She also stated that we would receive credit for all our overage charges for the month.  Altho she said we couldn\\'t change plans, my husband and I are now on the NATIONWIDE PLAN with  300 min. and 1 GB of data.  I wanted our regular plan back, but that wasn\\'t happening.  Lauren told us to call *611 at end of month and we would be able to get all charges credited.  We ALL know how easy that would be!!!!  HAHA  She spent quite a bit of time on the phone, trying to get our new plan, but hours later, she knew we were upset. Lauren finally told us \"Don\\'t think I\\'m happy about spending hours with you either.  We work on commission in here and only get paid when we sell.  With that, she handed us this paper and dismissed us.\\nI finally convinced my son to call Verizon, which he did.  Within 5 minutes, our plans had been changed to the Unlimited.  Luckily we didn\\'t have to do a 2 year contract, because after 27 years with Verizon, I feel it may be time to move on.\\n\\nVerizon went from being an amazing company, with the best customer service and assistance around.  The staff was knowledgeable, and beyond helpful.  NOW....as with other companies that have grown so big, they really don\\'t need you...so really don\\'t care if you stay loyal or not.   Such a SAD commentary on what used to be a GREAT company.\\n\\nI see other reviews that are stating the same problems with this location.  Is it the location, or is it Verizon?',\n",

The first time, many of the dishes, especially the pasta and the appetisers, were huge portions that will serve at least two, if not more. Our server forgot to mention this, and so our group of five ordered far more food than any of us could possibly eat. The second time, all the portions were smaller. No idea why.

I've tried the sesame and orange chicken and thought it was good, not like Chinatown in NYC but still worthy of a mention. The chicken is well cooked and seasoned. The fried rice is much better than what I'm used to. It's not all that greasy. The eggroll isn't special, but spring rolls are always the better option anyways.

When I asked for a refund (for initially delivering poor quality flowers, and then not even redelivering the same arrangement as promised) they refused, but what was worse (and why I am writing this) is they suggested that my girlfriend perhaps didn't want flowers but was after my money instead! I was appalled that they would even make such a statement to a customer! I explained how she loves flowers and how I've sent her several times over the past year from other places and they have always been great quality and she has been very happy with them.

I'm sure we all could use $25. :)\\n\\nIt was a very clean pharmacy and they had plenty of staff on hand to take care of requests and to greet customers. Service 5/5 ambiance 4/5...

This year we started at the Monte Carlo and ended up at the MGM before it was time to go back home.\\nThe most important part of our trip is not gambling but relaxation and with that comes the expectation of laying out by a wonderful pool and having lunch, reading, sleeping, swimming oh and drinking (not too much but a bit) frozen Pink Lemonade with Absolute Citroën Vodka, YUM! \\nWe loved our stay at the MGM.  It is such a large property with so much to do and so close to other popular properties like New York New York.  The guestroom was very modern and the bed was exceptionally comfortable.  The swimming pool area was FABULOUS!  Although it is quite a trek from the guestroom to the pool, it is worth every step.  I love the layout, theirs an adult area, the music is just the right decimal, and they have a friendly and accessible wait staff.  The food was reasonably priced and acceptable.  I say reasonably because remember we are in Vegas, lying by the pool and someone is waiting on us and the only work we have to do is chew and swallow our food and drink.\\nThe Lazy River is fun and you can even take your drink with you!  This is not the case in many other hotel pools.  We chatted with some guests but I was not in the mood to socialize but rather really relax.  The impression I got though was if you were interested in socializing, you could.\\nWe received two free buffet tickets one for my husband and I each and we did try the main buffet for breakfast.  I am not a fan of buffets but I was quite surprised at the quality of the food as well as the broad selection offered.  I would definitely eat at the main buffet if we were ever to stay at the MGM again.\\nThis property is huge so if you have an aversion to walking do not stay at the MGM.  The guestroom elevators are far from the main entrance.  The pool is quite a distance from the guestroom elevators as well.  However, if you do not mind walking, love Lazy Rivers, and enjoy many options for shopping and dining then stay at the MGM.',\n",

       "  \"Spent a good hour talking with Lynn from this dealership about a BMW I was interested in. Lynn ran my credit and came up with an interest rate double that of a local credit union. So I decide to go with the credit union and arrange for them to put the deal through and set up an appointment for me to go see the car after work. This dealership was completely across town during rush hour traffic (~40 minutes). I get to the dealership for my appointment and was not acknowledged, the car was not even on lot but I did see some service guy speed off in what looked like a Z4. Go back inside, still not acknowledged. Finally left and had to drive another 30 minutes home burning up some good ole premium in my current Bimmer. It seems like all this dealership is interested in is putting people into PREDATORY loans on branded title cars that have 50% the value of a non-branded title car. So when you are in an accident, the insurance company leaves you with a mess of a bill to pay off to get right with the loan. Lynn all of the sudden didn't even know how to submit loan information to a credit union, even though she had mentioned the dealership doing business with that credit union earlier in our conversation (probably because there was no kick back from the double interest loan to be had anymore). Just save your time and shop somewhere else unless you really want a flooded out, stolen, or abused car for a small discount off retail value which is immediately underwater on a loan due to its branded title status. Plus, the customer service does not exist here, and no apologies were made. Biggest waste of 2 hours of my life...EVER.\",\n",

I really tried to refrain from having to write a bad review, but thanks to Bill, he\\'ll get what he deserves.  \\n\\nThere is a rewards program that offers a $15 gift voucher for every 250 points earned. $1=1 point. It also states that you receive 20% more points for cash payments.  After my last visit in October I reached 277 points so I asked Bill (the manager) if I would be receiving my gift card voucher and he said no. He said I only reached 277 points because I am a cash paying customer and that it also has to be at 250 points before checkout to receive the voucher. I was at 252 points before checkout, but he said that\\'s because I paid cash. SO WHAT? That shouldn\\'t even matter. 252 is 2 points more than 250! Anyway, these two things he told me are NOT listed anywhere on the receipt or anywhere in the salon. Naturally I was confused because what Bill said does not match up with what is written on the receipt and I was upset because Bill was extremely rude to me about it.  As a loyal customer if I am confused about something then clarify in a nice respectful manner. Bill said I will receive the voucher at my next visit.  I was so upset the last time with how Bill treated me that I wasn\\'t going to go back, but I decided I would give the place another try. \\n\\nAfter my pedicure today I went to pay and I asked Bill about the voucher. He told me that I would receive the voucher, but would have to use it at my next visit. That\\'s the some crap he told me the last time! So every time I go spend my money I\\'m just going to keep hearing \"Next time?\" I don\\'t mind paying for services at all, but don\\'t offer a rewards program if you can\\'t fulfill it! Then Bill had the nerve to tell me that he would give me the voucher, but that he would no longer offer me the rewards program because he said it was too confusing to me, and that he would still offer it to everyone else, just not me. NEWS FLASH: IF IT\\'S CONFUSING TO ME, IT\\'S CONFUSING TO OTHERS. I\\'m an English Major and I can read. Nowhere does it state exclusions or any of the other B.S. that he was trying to come up with. I have been a loyal customer who has also referred 3 other customers to his business and he was EXTREMELY RUDE, IGNORANT, and OUTRIGHT DISRESPECTFUL. When I told him I was upset he did not apologize one time because he didn\\'t care. I could tell he didn\\'t care. As a person who grew up in a successful family business I know the true value of customer service. If a customer doesn\\'t understand a policy, explain it RESPECTFULLY. Don\\'t get nasty and in my face because you think you\\'re making sense. I told Bill he should have someone else explain it to me if he felt like he couldn\\'t, but do not talk down to me or treat me like dirt.

My business was not appreciated and I refuse to be talked to and disrespected the way that I have been by Bill. He had the nerve to do this in front of other customers, but regardless there is no excuse for treating a customer the way he treated me.

Which translates to a minimum wait time of 1 hour... we waited 2 and a half.\\n\\nYES, 2 and a half hours standing in line in the middle of a casino to eat at this tiny little bar that serves amazing food. I rarely ever find myself in line for that long for any other reason. I wouldn't even wait that long to get a blowjob from Justin Bieber. That's just a ridiculously long time, and yet... I was still blown away.\\n\\nThe food is Cajun themed and serves a variety of Creole style food. I ordered the Jambalaya(+++), others in my party ordered the Seafood Bake(++), Gumbo, and Cioppino (fish stew+++). Aside from the Gumbo, which was a tad salty, the food was the best damn Creole food I've ever had.\\n\\nThe food is cooked in individual pans that are cooked right in front of you by a single chef. This dude runs around like a maniac, doing all the prepping, seasoning, oyster-shucking, clam-steaming, and rice-cooking. He is a machine and yet still so friendly. He kept working at a furious pace, but would still be able to converse with the seated individuals. He would be the an amazing bartender if he could mix drinks like the way he cooks.\\n\\nAll the ingredients are fresh, and the oysters are individually wrapped to ensure quality every time. After deciding upon a spiciness level (1-10) you get to watch the master work. Side note: I ordered a 4, and am a big fan of spicy food. I figured if it wasn't hot enough, I'll just add more hot-sauce. It was pretty darn perfect. A nice kick, but not too over-powering. My fellow diners ordered a 5 and 6, and the 6 was starting to get pretty intense.\\n\\nThe portions are huge, I finished only 2/3 of my Jambalaya and was shocked 'cause I have been left to starve and wince in hunger for 2 hours prior. The presentation is simple, but due to the quality and quantity of the food, it looked absolutely delicious.\\n\\nOverall, I would say this is definitely an AMAZING hidden secret in Vegas. But the Palace Station is off-strip and a little annoying to take a cab just for this meal. But if you ever find yourself in the area and are down for some GREAT seafood, this should definitely be an option... just be prepared to wait an ungodly amount of time.\",\n",

Afterward, the old guy would always look and feel good.   \\n\\nAfter years of shaving with various disposable razors, I decided to give myself a treat.

I was looking for a fun place to go do something with my girlfriend that was outside the realm of  typical Vegas activities for date night (clubs, bars, etc.), and while looking through the highest rated activities, I came across this place.  First of all, the fact that it got a five-star rating was astounding, as not even a large majority of the pricier activities received nearly as high a rating.  Secondly, both my girlfriend and I loved the numerous \"room escape\" apps that we have tried on our phones, and the fact that we would be able to escape a room for real appealed to both of us.  Thirdly, after speaking with various staff members (the owner, Nick, included), I can honestly say that not only are they very courteous and friendly, but that they have done their research when it comes to how to construct the rooms and the individual puzzles within them.  \\n               We and two other couples did the Sherlock Room together, and WE ALL HAD A BLAST!  Normally, I have a tendency to want to work alone while solving intellectual problems, but I found out very quickly that in order to efficiently solve the puzzle and escape, teamwork IS REQUIRED.  We would have loved to try some of the other rooms, but since we were the last group of the night, we will have to come back another day.  \\n             To address the one gripe that some of the people had (specifically, the lack of decor), I say the following: they have only been open a few months, and though they have been very successful, they are still a \"new business\"; Nick (the owner) is the mastermind behind all of the rooms and not only has to maintain the current rooms, but also be thinking of new puzzles and ideas for rooms to come, as the rooms have to be cycled to keep the variety and interest level up--so a permanence of decor is not in the best interests of the business or the consumers.  \\n            All in all, the experience is one of a kind.  It is not only a great mental challenge, but also an excellent team building exercise and a wonderful date activity as well.  Whether you are a local or just in for a quick visit to our town, you have to pay Nick, Rosie, and the rest of the crew a visit  down at the Live Room Escape!',\n",

I know my soul food, especially coming from down south, I know it should be made with LOVE. The food wasn't even made with love like a real soul food place. I got the BBQ chicken and it just looked like they boiled some chicken and added BBQ sauce on top! The collard greens were good though. Majority of the waitress were rude and didn't check on my table. The yams seemed like it just came out of a can or something. I barely touched it. I was really looking forward to this place because I've been craving soul food ever since I've moved here and I wanted to find a really good place like back at home, but this place is disappointing!

It tasted like salad carbornara; rich, eggy, with just the right amount of bleu cheese and bacon.  The filet mignon and new york strip were an experience like no other.  They literally melt in your mouth!  The assorted mushrooms were also amazing.  We learned about a new mushroom, hen of the woods, that paired perfectly with the steak.  Finally, all the desserts were amazing.  Even though I'm not a huge fan of bread pudding, I couldn't stop eating the brioche bread pudding with apple pie ice cream.  I have to say something about the level of service.  They found the perfect balance of servicing us but not being intrusive.  Everyone was personable and courteous.  It's clear they all love working there and they did their best to make sure we felt right at home.  It was fairly quiet in our booth; perfect for a romantic meal.

I really didn't expect much, but was pleasantly surprised with my most recent visit.  \\n\\nThis Firestone is new (opened in March 2012), clean, and the service is impeccable. One thing that I should point out right away is that I do not have to pay a single dime on my car, like ever.  That's because my car is part of a fleet and the company I work for pays for everything from the gas, car washes, and maintenance.  This is just one of those perks by having a company car.  So when it comes to price, I cannot rate whether it's good or bad.  But I dig this Firestone purely based on their customer service, professionalism, and their lobby.  Yes, I said lobby.  This Firestone has one of best lobbies for an auto care center.  Seats are comfortable leather or pleather, non of that hard plastic stuff.  Each seat even has a foldable side table and they also have free wifi.\\n\\nMy most recent service was an oil change and tire rotation.  Start to finish took less than 40 minutes.  This has to be the best Firestone that I ever been to.  I think I just found my new favorite auto care shop.\",\n",

I believe there is an actual connection between the two, but stepping in here, you'd really see the connection for yourself if you're familiar with the Cheesecake Factory. The menu is very diverse and huge, with a variety of items to choose from. Grand Lux Cafe is located inside of the Palazzo Hotel, which was very convenient for me and my group since that's where we were staying. Great place for us to dine because we were able to just get ready in our hotel room, then go downstairs for dinner before heading out to the clubs or walking the strip. Price is great for what you get; just expect Cheesecake Factory pricing with the same big type of portion size as well! Great for sharing entrees, which is exactly what us 10+ girls did.

Seafood was fresh and the flavors were excellent.\\nMeat and Cheese: piece of perfectly cooked medium rare soft tenderloin and a slice of brie cheese atop a slice of baguette.  Delish!\\nMushroom Risotto:  cooked al dente.  This was good but it didn't blow me out of the water.\\nFried Calamari: calamari could have been bigger.  I felt like I was mostly eating fried batter.  The roasted pepper sauce was good but not great.\\nBacon Wrapped Dates: I've had this dish tons of times before and I sometimes even make it at home but this wasn't very good here.  I think it was mainly because it was fried.  I had never had this dish fried but I didn't think it added anything to it.  As the matter of fact, the fried aspect brought this dish down.\\nCrispy Pancetta:  pork belly with molecular mozzarella with a shot glass of pea puree.  I wasn't impressed by this dish at all.  I didn't get the whole molecular mozzarella especially because I didn't think it added much to the dish.  You can barely taste it.  The pea puree?  Eh, it wasn't great either.

Reason why there's a wait because this place is that good if you enjoy a quick eat instead of going to the Spice Market Buffet which is also good. Even with the long wait, you won't have that of a hard time to find a table because place is on the go; they order, eat and leave so by the time your order is ready, a table should be ready for you as well. Or the other option is to have another person reserve the seat while you order or vice versa. I haven't had much time waiting for my order after I've ordered and paid but I've seen other customers wait a while for their order either because of the confusion from the employees or just way too many people here. Plenty of employees working here so not sure why some people have to wait so long for their order to show up. You'll notice also that sometimes they take orders in waves. First batch orders and then they'll wait a while before they take the next person's order in a way to not make the place too crowded. \\n\\nI've tried most of their sandwiches here. Highlights for me are their Holiday Turkey, Full Montagu, Chipotle Chicken Avocado and their Hawaiian BBQ. I also recommend getting their Tomato Soup - one of the best I've had. Not too salty and they fill it up with small pieces of bread. You won't be disappointed with their sandwiches here.\",\n",

I had heard from friends that certain areas lacked visual or audio quality and it was like you had to choose which you prefer. I had great seats for both shows... John Legend in the first level left side partierre (?) and Book of Mormon in the right side orchestra. \\n\\nThe box for John Legend had these free standing high top chairs that were cool because you could turn or move them but got incredible uncomfortable as the show went on. Additionally, I had nowhere to put drinks and if you get the wrong person in front of you it can be quite difficult to see the show. Sound quality in these seats was excellent though!\\n\\nThe orchestra for Book of Mormon provided fantastic visual experience but poor sound quality. I found it tough to understand what the performers were saying at some points and many of the lyrics to the songs were hard to understand so I felt like I missed out on a lot of the show.\\n\\nThe bars could use some work... service is a bit slow and they are very small. Why not have a cool lounge or something with a full bar? They have the space for it.\\n\\nAll in all though, the Smith Center offers a fantastic experience and is a beautiful building. The staff both indoors and out are top notch and they do an amazing job of controlling the crowd leaving the venue. Look forward to heading back for more shows in the future.\",\n",

We bought tickets to see the Cirque Du Soleil Zarkana show at Aria. After the show we stumbled upon Five50 nestled away in a back corner on the lobby level of the hotel. The restaurant received some good reviews on Yelp, so we decided to check it out. Now Five50 is our go-to pizza spot!\\n\\nIt is labeled as a \"casual pizza experience,\" but the ambience of the hotel and restaurant add to its charm. As you walk into the restaurant, there is a long counter that acts as an extension of the kitchen. Here you can place to go orders for pizza and other items. There are also tables just outside the restaurant where you can stand and eat your pizza for a quicker dining experience. The restaurant has definite character and personality. A long curved wall of wooden blocks stacked on top of each other separate the diners from the rest of the hotel/casino. Behind the restaurant is the sports book room where sports junkies can get their fix and gamble on events. There is a circular bar located in the center of the restaurant, along with tv\\'s for your viewing pleasure. The service was a little hit and miss, but overall decent. \\n\\nThe menu offers eclectic pizza choices such as the truffle pizza (I would recommend this!), soups/salads, and pastas. The pizza is prepared fresh and cooked perfectly. Five50 offers a unique casual pizza experience with good food, and all the benefits of a Vegas establishment.',\n",

The airport is directly across the street so if you are a light sleeper this may not be the place for you, I however slept through the night without issue. Close to some local spots both to eat and shop, I got my sister a birthday cake at 6am along with flowers.

The room is beautiful and located across from the giant Fashion Show Mall, all valet hotel, the service was a little slow.

Housekeeping was also on hand with I was cooking the lasagnas. We did have to call them three times to come up, again, I think that is a staffing issue.\\n\\nTip: Since this is an all valet hotel call valet prior to going downstairs so that they can bring your car up. Also, strip facing views are amazing... we stayed in Penthouse 6000. It is not a casino so keep that in mind if you plan on booking and I didn't think the restaurant there was that great either.

Both of our daughters ordered the fettuccine Alfredo. I thought the sauce could've used a little more salt, pepper and Parmesan, but it was it was still good. My son ordered the Philly. He said it was AMAZING. He usually doesn't eat much and he devoured the entire thing. They have all kinds of desserts there too. We had a bag of little fried pieces of dough coated in powdered sugar.

We were greeted right away and were taken to our seats. We were thankful as other reviews indicated that it could get busy. Keep in mind there are two locations in Chinatown Vegas.\\n\\nThe menu was easy to follow. We ordered a pound of crawfish, 2 pounds of shrimp, sausage, and corn on the cob in Cajun style. It was scrumptious. The shrimp and crawfish weren't over cooked. It was seasoned well, flavoring was good, and it wasn't too spicy for my palate. It was rich and buttery goodness. Let the corn soak up all the sauce and then suck the juice and bite into it. Heavenly. You could even order a side of rice. \\n\\nOur waitress was attentive and she refilled our drinks regularly. She was well mannered and positive. This was one meal that we enjoyed most in Vegas. It was such a great experience. A must visit when we return.\",\n",

Everything was fine the first 2-3 months until one day I went up Mt Charleston. Coming down the mountain the car started shaking violently when the brakes started to get heated. It was like a space shuttle reentering earth's atmosphere. I brought the car back in and told them they sold me a car with faulty brakes and its needs to get fixed. They firmly refused.\\n\\nSecond encounter - One day I noticed my door panel was starting to peel up by the window on both doors, maybe from the heat. I still had my factory warranty and brought it in for a replacement. The man documented the problem and ordered the parts. When I received the call to come in for the repair (2 months later), I was told that only one panel was ordered and that they made a mistake. So after they installed the one they had they told me the car was ready. When I inspected the work, the door panel was just hanging on the door, loosely attached. I couldn't even believe they gave it back to me like that. Then they told me they didn't order the correct part for the door and had to use the warped piece from the faulty one. So now the new one is not attached correctly and looks bent.\\n\\nThird encounter - Around October that year I noticed a clunking noise coming from the front end suspension. I was reaching the end of my factory warranty and needed to get it in before it expired. I ended up getting it to service with about 35,980 miles on it. Warranty expires at 36k so this was my only opportunity. I left the car with them for a day and a half, about 36 hours. After getting the car back and drove it home I didn't notice anything. The next day I had to drive about 30 miles to a site and it clunking the whole way there. I have no idea what they even replaced. When I got my car back it was very close to closing time and I was told by the service person they had no idea what the techs did but would email me the info. After 3 emails and 2 calls, I gave up. My warranty is currently expired and it's not their problem. Now I'll have to pay out of pocket for a repair that was covered under the factory warranty.\\n\\nFourth encounter - Its Dec 1 and I called the parts department to see if the second door panel came in yet. Apparently they have no such item and no record of the order ever being placed. After numerous calls and being hung up on, I finally got them to order the part that should have been ordered 7 months ago. Left the manager a message but I doubt, from the track record of this place, I will receive a call back.\\n\\nThe negligence and incompetence is nothing short of astounding within this business.

It began as usual, bad hostess, 45min wait, more bad service, but the food was good. Then, we tried to use our stamp card which was for a free AYCE that was expired by mere days and were refused. The point of the stamp card is that you get 9 AYCE stamps in one year and you get one free, obviously you need to obtain these in a year so its worth while for the restaurant. All of our stamps were from the same year, it just \"expired\" and they wouldn\\'t honor it. We actually have multiple stamp cards from here and this one happened to get missed the last time we ate here.

What can I say, sounds like a great deal right?  Well, it was a great experience marred by some new hotel \"growing pains.\"  Here\\'s what happened, check-in is 3pm, we arrived 3:10pm on Sunday and was told our rooms were not ready due to guests requesting late check-out.  Luckily we didn\\'t have anything planned so we just wandered around the hotel.  We overhead many frustrated guests who were \"dealing\" with the mgr because of this inconvenience..  I thought this was a bad start to our vacation.  They took our cell number and promised to call us asap.  Well, after an hour of walking around we went back to the front desk to check and got our room.  Hmm.. why did they take our cell?  There were still people arguing with the staff about not being able to check in and I wondered if we never check with them, if they would ever call us.  We got a room on the 35th floor which was nice but wasn\\'t facing the strip.  We also have to ask for the package promos, something that irritated me more since that shouldn\\'t be something we should be requesting.  After all its right on their computer screen..  Everyone was very apologetic about the inconvenience but nothing was offered at all (I thought a comped drink at the Rojo lounge would be nice).  So now the room.. wow.. what can I say..  modern, comtemporary...  it has a mini-kitchen..  mini-fridge (with ice!)..  jacuzzi jets in the tub, rain shower and of course twin plasmas.  but there were also some issues.. the marble(?) tile flooring in the bathroom and hallway is dirty (the floor got wet, I wiped with a towel and it turned black).  there was an used coffee pod in the coffee maker...  the bath tub had \"bits and particles\" in it (we rinsed it twice)..  missing beer slot in the fridge(are they gonna charge us?)..  and the grand finale..  the door would not lock..  apparently (this is from the \"engineering\" guy). .the weather strip is still new so you have to slam the door to make sure it locks.. if you close the door like a normal polite person then the lock won\\'t engage and you can just push the door open..  nice huh?   We had to postpone our dinner plans because of this door problem..  the engineering guy probably thought we\\'re strange in that we don\\'t slam doors but then I never had this problem before..  \\n\\nwe got our cabana the next day...  pretty nice.. really warm in the cabana though so hard to relax in there..   we inquired about the complementary water/fruit listed in the menu that comes with every cabana..  our waitress promptly snaps back \"comped cabanas don\\'t come with those\"  Oh, thanks for pointing that out with your bitch face...  pool was nice (only 4.5 deep)..  music was loud so it was hard to focus on our books..  ordered a burger and lobster roll from bitch face...  burger was good.. but she forgot to give us utensils..  I should\\'ve just eat all with my hands and then wash them off in the pool..  the pool attendants were nice though..just our waitress had the attitude (guess it must be hard to work in a bathing suit serving sub-par food all day).  \\n\\nhere\\'s the best part of our trip.. Drift spa..   attendants are very friendly...   we got in for free of couse with our package.. normally $30 just to go in...the wet spa is nice... jacuzzi, steam room, sauna..  too hot for me...  the turkish Hamam (ambient steam?) is rather nice as  both me and my wife were able to lay out on the stone..  we came back again that day just to use the Hamam..  remember to tell the spa people to spray the eucalyptus spray aromatherapy in the Hamam before you go in.. \\n\\nwe requested late checkout and was given 12:30pm.. asked 1pm and they said ok..  when we did check out we have to ask them to apply the dining credit to our balance..  again this is something that we shouldn\\'t have to ask for..  and it was the manager who helped us too...  \\n\\ndefinetly has room for improvement and need to train the staff better including their management..  would come back again..check their website for promo packages...',\n",

Plus, people did not really come through there to shop, anyway- jeez, retail suicide. There was a little stage in the middle where there would be some performances but I can't say that it was very professional. So, not surprisingly, the movie theater was affected, though this came about a few years later. \\n\\nI miss this closed movie theater the most in the whole center. It was a very nice movie theater with slightly discounted movie ticket prices and free parking- validated and had excellent sound. Clean facility, full staff. It as empty though. So, an announcement said the theater would close for renovations. A few days later on the news confirmed that it would be closing for good. So sad.\\n\\nI like downtown. In my many years in LV, I've never spent New Year's on the Strip (not crazy like that), but I have come to the Fremont Street Experience a couple times. I think that attraction has improved over the years. There are a few good restaurants in the area as well (aloha specialties, mickie finzz, the golden gate). But Neonopolis is an idea never realized- it didn't have a chance. The neon signs were really neat because it was a way to bring back a little something from the Old Vegas (you know, when people dressed up for no reason at all- like the old movies- suits, hats & dresses). Also, Jillian's was a cool little place but it closed and became something else (but don't know how that's going).\",\n",

The lovely lady attendant then asked what I would like to drink, and brought my chamomile tea with honey on the side.  While I waited I flicked through the latest issue of Glamour magazine and read up on \"The Best Ways to Please a Man.\"  Shortly thereafter I was gathered by Dawn who guided me toward the nail polish where I chose a color for my toes and nails.  We then proceeded to the pedicure chairs.  Wow, I was sat in a massaging, heated pedicure chair in front of floor to ceiling windows.  What a lovely, calming view!  Dawn did a good job on my nails, and was a fountain of information.  I asked her about XS and Tryst, as well as other Vegas Insider knowledge.  The paraffin wax on my feet was amazing and Dawn\\'s foot massage felt amazing.  It\\'s definitely a must by anyone who has the time.',\n",

He really likes coming here and gets excited the minute he gets to the door.\\n\\nThey run a really responsible day care too.

The most important thing for me is the decor of the room -- most hotel rooms just have dark, dingy decor -- especially after staying at NYNY, MGM grand and Planet Hollywood, I know this for a fact.  That or the rooms are super outdated.  This was one of the prettiest hotel rooms Ive stayed in.  Nice and spacious, with beautiful modern deco decor.  I had a pool view which was gorgeous.  The room was clean and everything looked new, and there were robes in the room which is always nice.\\n\\nThe people at the front desk were okay.  One guy was not personable at all but the girl I spoke with while checking out was better.  Nothing over the top though - Ive had better service at 4* hotels on that front.  \\n\\nMy main complaint here was eating.  There arent a lot of choices. Im traveling alone and I dont want anything fancy, which is the class that most of the restaurants there fell into. A lot of stuff closes early too -- Jean Phillipe closed at 11pm here but at 12pm in Aria, which is weird.

Every single one ive had has made my drinks perfect, has been extremely friendly, knowledgeable and efficient. The coffee itself is great too as well as the different foods they chose to highlight. \\nIll end off with saying the management is horrible. I walked in on a busy monday morning, there was only 1 barista for about 8 customers. He was working extremely hard, still made my coffee perfect. But what really really got to me was that 2 of the managers (i assume because ive seen them before) were sitting chatting and completely ignoring the fact that the barista couldve used a hand. I watched one manager walk up behind the bar, \"oh hes going to start helping\"... to my suprise, he went back to pour HIMSELF coffee and sat back down. Really inconsiderate and was extremely frustrating for me to watch especially because i waited 20 minutes for my drink (not the baristas fault).\\nIn the end, coffee and staff is 10/10 but the management makes me not want to come back.',\n",

Happy hour includes buy one get one free drinks (same drink) and half off appetizers. \\n\\nOur waitress was really nice and got our multiple drinks and food orders. As a group we got the dirty martini, aloha Felicia, Moscow mule, lychee martini, old fashion, Manhattan,and angry cucumber. For food we got the pizette, lollipop chicken wings, wagu beef tacos, meatball sliders, poke cones. \\n\\nThe view:  5 stars. Amazing views and atmosphere. Very classy. Since the lounge is on top of the restaurant, they don't blast music which I liked so I can hear our conversations. \\n\\nFood : 3.5 stars. Better than most happy hour places but it's definitely a small portion. You probably need two or three to fill you up. The pizza is more like a tart. Chicken wings and tacos were good though!\\n\\nDrinks:  4 stars. Some were really good. Some tasted funny. For example the lychee martini had no hints of lychee. The Moscow Mike could have used a little more lime. The angry cucumber was really good though. It's only for people who could tolerate spicy. \\n\\nPrices: 2 stars. At happy hour... The prices are decent. Still a little more expensive than other happy hour places but I would gladly pay for the view and atmosphere. Drinks will be 8 to 10 bucks each but they are strong (normally it's 16 to 20 but the buy one get one makes it 8 bucks each). I would not come here if it wasn't happy hour.\",\n",

Pretty cool.\\n\\nWe ordered our food and were all surprised with amount of food that came out. The portions are HUGE. I ordered a filet that while huge was a little bland. The twice baked potatoes were good but tasted like they'd been frozen at some point. The desert was okay but also had a frozen taste.\\n\\nif I was judging this restaurant on the food it would have been a 3 star review but the service was pretty awful. Just slow, unconcerned and borderline rude. \\n\\nNot saying I would never try this place again but for the money there is so many options that would blow this place out of the water.\",\n",

The prime rib here is 10 x's better than the one at Ellis Island ($14.99). \\n\\nMy gfs and I were starving after our drive back to Vegas from CA and wanted to try Primarily Prime Rib. A friend and I wanted to try the cowboy cut ( 26 oz. bone in for $29.95) but found out that there is a $10 extra plate charge so we all decided to go with the southpoint cut ($18.95). It came with your choice of prime or spinach salad OR their soup of the day AND a bake potato OR mashed potatoes OR vegetables.\\n\\nYou start off with a sour dough bread and some butter. I enjoyed the sour dough because it wasn't super sour and it was crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. \\n\\nWe ordered 3 southpoint cuts, 2 cooked medium and 1 cooked medium rare. I got the mashed potatoes and the spinach salad with dressing on the side. I would recommended getting dressing on the side because they did drench my friends' prime salad in thousand island dressing. I did not like the dressing that came with the spinach salad so I used balsamic vinegar but I'm sure you can swap the vinegarette out for something else. I was surprised to find out that the mashed potatoes weren't made from a box. There were actual chunks of potatoes! However, the baked potato looked a lot better and its made table side so I would recommend the baked potato. They added sour cream, butter and chives. If you want any of those on the side, make sure to let them know. All the prime rib entrees came out perfectly cooked. They were soft and not too fatty. Both of my friends enjoyed their meal. \\n\\nService was really good. Lighting was perfect, not too bright nor too dim. The music wasn't playing super loudly either. Booths were comfortable. Its a good spot to bring a date or to celebrate something. While I have had better prime rib, for the price, service and quality, it was a good deal! Can't wait to come back.\",\n",

       "  'Visited Tacos El Gordo last Saturday at 11 AM. The place was already packed and the security guard lady was already giving people directions on how to order their tacos (unheard of if you go to the Tijuana location). The lines were not very clear and the menu was hard to see because of the décor hanging from the ceiling.\\n\\nI had my usual, tacos de carne asada. They looked and tasted legit! So the wait was worth it. Corn tortillas were handmade, salsa and guacamole on point and asada cooking over fire. I truly enjoyed my tacos and wished I had order 6 instead of just 4. I was very disappointed that they didn\\'t have Mexican Coca-Cola or Fanta. They only have canned sodas and a fountain drink machine. Tacos were $2.25 each and the fountain drink was $2.00 (cheapest meal on the strip I tell you).\\n\\n***\\n\\nDecided to come back on Sunday before heading back home. Well, they say they open at 9 AM, but in reality they didn\\'t start serving people until 9:30 Am ( I waited about 45 minutes outside...the smell of the asada I tell you). When we finally got to order I ordered 5 asada tacos, well I noticed that the guacamole was missing, so I asked where is the guac? The taco man replied \"we don\\'t have any until the evening.\" I was VERY DISAPPOINTED that they did not have an essential ingredient on their tacos yet again they still charged me full price. \\n\\nAfter a mixed experience, here is a rundown of my review and suggestions for the owner:\\n\\n- Food: Come over in the evening for tacos. I will never come at opening time, they were not ready to serve their clients. The wait is worth it later in the day when the tacos will be served with all the ingredients. Owner: Make sure you got EVERYTHING ready for your customers at opening time.\\n\\n- Service: The women who work behind the cash register and the cleaning ladies, they were pretty cold, no smile, no \"how you doing?\" The taquero, no smile, but hey, thanks for making me some delish tacos.\\n\\n- Location: Not enough area to sit inside/outside. I understand that it gets super crowded inside, therefore, have something like a long bar table area outside. I don\\'t mind eating tacos standing up, but at least have a surface where I can put my plate and drink while I eat.\\n\\nThe way they separate the ordering areas by meat...please get rid of this. It causes confusion and unnecessary extra long lines for one type of taco. Instead, open at least three stations that serve all type of tacos, mulitas, etc. Also, don\\'t have the security lady directing people where to go. I witnessed her running people out of the place by telling them that the line for asada was too long. Instead, have her do her job of making sure people don\\'t steal tacos or get into a fight only. Also, clear the menu view...we get it, we love Mexico, but having \"banderitas\" hanging all over the place? obstructing the menu? not cool.\\n\\nOverall, I will return next time I visit Las Vegas.',\n",

The handyman told us that we had severe hidden water damage for long long time since the date of faulty garbage disposal installation (which was installed many many years ago)  and the damage was beyond the control (cabinet, wall, mold...), and he gave us the phone number of the restoration company, and asked us call them immediately before calling the home insurance company, and the restoration company will work with home insurance company and file the claim.\\nTomorrow is Thanksgiving, but now we had to deal with severe water damage issues. We were very worried and stressed, but also had some questions. Because we had several people come to fix the pipe/faucet last year and there were never any indications that there were issues of garbage disposal or water damage. Also the back of our cabinet was not facing the wall and looked OK. \\nSo we went on yelp to find a reputed restoration company instead the one recommended by the handyman. Here you go, we found Richard! Upon talking to Richard, he came to our place almost within 10 minutes. After the inspection, Richard told us that there is no water damage, there is none!  Richard instructed us how to dry the cabinet and he did not charge us anything.  \\nI am really impressed by his honesty and professionalism and his courage to do the right thing! He is a person with decency and integrity. He gave us a great holiday present and  relieved us from the stress. I truly believe that Richard will have a great success in his business.

       "  \"My first experience could have easily been a 5 star one, as my breakfast itself was FANTASTIC! The crab omelette was great, and the spuds were amazing! The cheese dip goes wonderfully with the potatoes. I even redeemed my Yelp Check in and got the Blue Tahoe Top Shelf Bloody Mary for $5. It was awesome! Not too spicy, a little extra A1 like I asked, and they didn't skimp on the vodka. \\n\\nHowever, aside from the actual breakfast meal itself, the experience was not good. We arrived before 11am (10:50ish) and were told it was a 15-20 minute wait. Not a problem by any means on a bright Sunday morning.\\n\\nAfter waiting 30 minutes I asked what order we were in the line up, and we were next. No more than 5 minutes after I was told this, another group of three was seated before us, even though they had only arrived 10 minutes prior. And my 10 minutes prior to me getting there, but they only waited a total of 10 minutes or less. This is not okay; I don't care who you know at the restaurant, but we were waiting. Strike one. \\n\\nAbout ten minutes after that transpired, I finally went up and asked if we could be seated as there were four open tables which had been vacant and cleaned for a good fifteen minutes. They said sure, pointed out the table, and that was it. Didn't give us menus, didn't walk us to the table....rather rude if you ask me. Strike two. (To lay out the timeline, we arrived at 10:50. Were seated at 11:45. So much for a 15-20 minute wait..........)\\n\\nFinally, after being seated for a while, they took our drink order. They were out of lemonade, so no Arnold Palmer for my father in law. Which he drinks EVERYWHERE. Okay, I get it. You're out of lemonade. It happens. So he orders an iced tea and asks for sweetenlow. They don't have sweetenlow. Seriously? Either someone messed up on ordering, or their food service distributor sucks. And on top of that, we had to ask twice to have our order taken after already waiting for nearly an hour. Strike three!\\n\\nHowever, after it taking over an hour to get seated and order our food, our food came rather expeditiously and was great. This leads me to believe the problem was definitely not in the kitchen. \\n\\nI overheard two short skirmishes between waitresses that were frustrated or angry, and another table had such a bad experience I'm pretty sure I overheard the head waitress comp their whole meal. (Wouldn't have minded mine getting comped........)\\n\\nJust a TERRIBLE customer service experience, and something should be done to rectify the situation so this doesn't happen again. Restaurant has amazing potential. The dining area itself is friendly, clean, and quirky, and the food is wonderful. The service staff needs to definitely step up the hell out of their game. I honestly felt like they were heavily understaffed, but there were 4 waitresses I identified, and 5 other staff members. Someone needed to step up to the plate.......\\n\\n\\nWould I come back here myself? Only if someone is going to guarantee me good service, otherwise there are plenty of other great breakfast joints in town. \\n\\nWould I recommend this place to other? Most definitely, but I'd give them fair warning that to get great food, you have to put up with crappy service.\",\n",

He was SO great with my son and my son is fidgety, hyper, talkative, exciting to say the least. We went through the motions and he was very thorough, answered all of our questions and recommended that he come back in a year to get another exam. Even though we did not have to get a prescription or go through the motions of ordering glasses I would definetly go back to have my personal eye exam with Dr. Yesnick\\'s office.

We were the last customers in the shop too (after close) and they didn\\'t make us at all feel rushed or like they wanted us to leave. The decor was gorgeous, the staff was great, and we both left very happy customers! . Highly highly recommend!',\n",

I wanted quick meal in the hotel (Luxor), but still wanted to be able to sit down so I ended up at Tacos and Tequila. I was in and out within 40 minutes which was pretty sweet.\\n\\nIt would not be fair to compare a taco in Vegas to the tacos I eat in California, but naturally I still strayed that route. It's not the same as Mexican food in California, but it's decent if you need a taco or tequila fix. \\n\\nComplimentary Chips with Two Salsas - The chips were a little thick. I like fresh fried thick and crispy or thin corn chips, but I'm not a big fan of the in between tortilla chip where it's a little thicker and really hard but not too crispy. This was an in between chip. The salsas were fine, they gave a red and a green salsa. \\n\\n#1 Alambre Taco Plate (Grilled Steak, Bacon, Chile Poblano, Onion, Cilantro, Oaxacan Cheese on Flour Tortilla) - It says on their menu that this is their #1 item and looking at their other offerings, I would agree. The taco is full of diced steak and bacon with a mild kick to it from the poblano chile. The flour tortilla was rolled thin so that was a positive surprise (I like thin vs. doughy). The plate came with rice and beans and this is where it went wrong. The black beans were good, but the rice was undercooked and gritty. Rice is the filler item and it's not hard to get right.  C'mon man! If you are craving some beef tacos, I recommend getting Alembre tacos, either a la carte or as a taco plate. Let's just hope your rice turns out better than mine were.\\n\\nService was good. I sat at the bar and they were fast with the water, chips and salsa and they did check on me after I received my food. They have flat screens with sports on in the bar area and they can fit sizable parties at the tables. Comparing to the other mid-range restaurants at the Luxor, T&T - Tacos and Tequila is probably one of your safer bets.\",\n",

The place is completely disorganized and unprofessional.  There are various appliances scattered around the front office in no particular order and the woman I had to deal with seemed like an idiot but what could I do?  I didn\\'t want to pay to repair the machine myself so I left it.   Two weeks goes by and nothing.  Call the shop, \"oh, yeah I think we have that in the back, let me check\".  \"oh, we still have to do more testing, probably a few more days\".  So I called the manufacturer and asked what\\'s going on because I\\'m now suspecting this shop is run by gypsy travelers.  I didn\\'t even get a receipt (which I should have insisted on, as well as take pictures of it) when I dropped it off.  The manufacturer (magic chef) put me on hold (or so they claimed) to call the shop and they said the shop told them there\\'s nothing wrong with the machine.  They ran it for a week with no problems.  Okay so if there\\'s nothing wrong with the machine then why did they insist on keeping it?  \"Um, I don\\'t know you have to wait a few more days\".  Okay, so I waited a few more days as they requested and then went back to the shop and demanded my machine back.  So this woman gives me the machine and she says \"you know it\\'s not fixed?\"  What the ... and of course it doesn\\'t work.  They just let the machine sit in the back of the warehouse for 3 weeks.  By the time I got it back, it smelled and their were bugs coming out the bottom, and now \\'magic chef\\' won\\'t honor the warranty because the shop (or so they claim) told them there wasn\\'t anything wrong with the machine.  I don\\'t know what kind of scam these people are running but there\\'s some sort of collusion going on between them and the manufacturer to screw people out of any warranty.',\n",

As a regular diner, I recognize the desire of the staff, the menu and the decor is to be its best and it\\'s missing the mark as the focus seems to be on all the wrong things.  First, we were told we weren\\'t able to sit because they had to first polish the glasses and silver before we could sit at tables that were already cleared with empty seats.  My mother was shaky standing with her cane so I asked if there was a place where she could sit.  It was then they ushered us to our table.  Needless to say, when the glasses finally arrived, they glistened, and were left empty as we waited for water and subsequent refills.  Our sparkling silver came much later...long after we had to wait to order.  As other reviewers noted...the staff appeared completely bewildered and lacking in direction.  As we sat ready to order we struggled to even see any servers...at one point we counted two (too few to cover the number of tables - many of which were empty) - and those two were impossible to make eye contact.  There was what appeared to be one buser, and he moved incredibly slow, and seemed challenged at doing his job - setting tables without cleaning the tops.  He could have been leveraged to also pour water (which was very delicious, seemingly filtered).  The bar was covered in dirty dishes, bottles and trash.  Finally, a server that we were told \"inherited us\" was very good, but it still didn\\'t stop us noticing that a number of tables seated after us were already eating.  I empathized with the chef who was yelling for servers to pick up their orders - it caused many of us to giggle and make eye contact with one another.  The restaurant should have runners to bring the food to the tables.  There are a number of other amusing anecdotes from our table as well as lore from BC locals about the service here and soup that was \"too cold to even bathe in\", but I will save those gems to be captured here via their own respective keyboards.',\n",

I believe that I counted at least six different kinds of peppers in the various dishes that we ate. I am not sure why they put tilapia  in the soup dish because you really couldn't taste it. That is is not exactly accurate but there were at least three kinds of peppers in this lemon grass-based soup or stew, not including the hot oil that created the cauldron of fire that was emanating from my from my mouth. In fact my wife was ready to take me to the hospital as the tears were running down my cheeks. I grow hot peppers at my house and enjoy heat, but my warning to my fellow caucasians is to be very careful of what you order in this restaurant. We ordered five dishes in which none of which exceeded one star for heat. By the way, I couldn't answer my wife of whether I wanted to go to the hospital because I really couldn't talk.\\n\\nMy mouth, my mouth...\\n\\nI am pretty sure that the combined Scofield count of what  I ate this evening was clearly in the millions. There was one small brownish crushed pepper in the above dish that I was not able to identify. That pepper alone created a circus in my mouth - no, more like a cirque de Soleil event. It was with this additional pepper  that I prayed there was some ice cream on the menu, but there was none. At one point I really could not talk to anybody at the table, because every taste bud on my tongue was stimulated (think fried, burnt, singed. \\n\\n24 hours later\\n\\nMy rectum\\nMy rectum\\n\\nThat's right, the experience continues. I think that same little black pepper may be the culprit. However it could've been the jalapeños or the Thai chilies. Maybe it was the hot chili oil that they used to cook several of the dishes with. My wife is very concerned, apparently, when I scream in the bathroom. It scares her. I don't care if it scares her, because I am in pain.\\n\\nYou learn a lot about various cultures by the food that they eat.  I will return to this restaurant the future. But lemongrass this got the best of me, but not next time. And by the way, if you have a cold but lemongrass dish was mouthless. There was mucus in cavities of my sinuses but I never knew existed.

Delicious and a fun texture experience.\\n\\nShanghai Dumplings 5/5\\nServed in a steamer, these dumplings are awesome. The meat filling is seasoned perfectly but the real treat is the liquid soup-type filling. I wasn't expecting it so the first one I bit into went all over my plate. After that I started eating them whole, and wow they were so good. I will definitely come back for these.\\n\\nSalt and Pepper Fried Fish 4/5\\nThe fish tasted fresh and the breading was crispy, but there was so much salt this dish was a little hard to keep eating. It tasted like this dish may have had a lot of MSG, not sure but you may want ask if it concerns you.\\n\\nAssorted Seafood Noodle Soup 3/5\\nThe noodles were good and broth was fine. The fish balls were good but the squid did not taste very fresh and spoiled this dish for me.\\n\\nSesame Mochi with Black Sweet Rice 4/5\\nUnique house made dessert. Delicious black forbidden rice with sweet coconut milk, soft sticky mochi balls with black sesame filling. Yummy.\",\n",

I typically order salad bowls for mine so I love that there are multiple options such as spinach, spring mix and kale. I will say the kale is quite disappointing, they're very large pieces that are dry (unlike massaged kale that's more tender). The fish quality is great, I love their salmon! AND they're not stingy with fish which is what makes me return each time. Aside from that they're very pleasant in the shop, I've never felt rushed ordering since I don't know their ordering process very well. I've personally ordered to go every time however I have noticed that there is not much space for dining in. I definitely recommend them for a healthy lunch or a healthy lite dinner but consider ordering to go!\",\n",

Then our menus. We decided quickly what we wanted to eat . Took over a half hour for the waitress to remember to take our order . Said she forgot about it and laughed. We ordered all our food at once to hopefully make up time.  Took another half hour for food to get out. The \"chips\" they brought for us to munch on were okay. Only gave us a single chip each! When they brought out our food, they almost gave it to the wrong table. Set the food in front of them and everything . Then the waitress remembered it wasn\\'t theirs and just switched the plates. May I note that the food wasn\\'t horrible. Too much odd flavor combos. But I DID NOT intend to spend over $70 on meat portioned the size of a chicken nugget.

In the past I've had the bananas foster French toast from Terrace Point Cafe which was much better than here. I noticed on this visit that Tableau had it and Terrace Point did not. Their version was better! My Mom also got a side of bacon which she requested be crispy. She really enjoyed it. We got a croissant which was amazing! If I could, I would eat one a day for the rest of my life! \\n\\nMultiple people waited on us throughout our dining experience. At least 4, maybe 5. It doesn't matter so much as long as you are being well taken care of but it is difficult to build a bond with your person and it's confusing come tip time because to me it seems more like a buffet restaurant tip than normal table service. \\n\\nThe only thing that takes away from outdoor dining here is the fact that birds will visit the empty tables and poke around. I feel like since the staff know this happens, they should be clearing the tables much quicker than they do. If the tables were cleared quicker, the birds wouldn't have anything to dine on. We saw some birds take a pastry and fly away. It bothered my Mom much more than it bothered me but it definitely isn't something that people want to see happening at a fancy, expensive breakfast.\",\n",

Last year I stayed at the Palazzo and the overall level of service was superb. We requested house keeping to go at 5:30pm and no one showed up, finally of wednesday house keeping was cleaning while we where in the room. My friend asked if they could change her bed and ahe said they would have to charge her for it, but she could leave the sheets for her... wth, it's  not like we got a free room we paid a lot of money to get the suite.  Lastly on our departure we called in to get our luggage out of the room at 10:50a.m. and asked for a late check out, not only did they not accomdate us, they keep tranferring us from one department to the other and kept being on hold. They said they could do the late check out and to get the service to pick up our luggage it would take 30-45minutes which we didnt have time to spare. So we had to carry all our belong to get them checked in so we could have breakfast. As we are walking down stairs most of the guest have their luggage too. Long store short, we had checked in out luggahe and had the car parked in valet.  By the time we where ready to leave I  was told it would take 15 minutes to get my car and luggage...

It put all those other cinema sound systems to shame or is this part of the IMAX experience?  If so, I love it! I was also impress with the sharp picture quality. However, the screen was curved which gave an unusual view from where I was seated. It was not a dome which was good but I would have prefer the viewing on a flat screen like most screens these days. It's a personal preference I understand and my opinion. And the uncomfortable 3D glasses I had to endure myself with while trying to enjoy the movie and experience. I mean the way these cheap plastic frame was shape, it put extreme pressure on the temple and the side of my head. Just awful! I know my head is on the big side but holy moly. If I had Yoda's head, it would be probably be comfortable but my head was more like chewbacca. I would rather had watch the non 3D showing if given the option or bring my own 3D glasses instead.

       "  'First of all, I am not one to complain about things nor people but we definitely did not have a good experience here. We visited Wildfire Lanes as a group of four and were told that the wait time would be about one hour to an hour and a half so we decided to stay and wait until they called us up. After 2+ hours of waiting at a small table we saw that everyone else had already been called except for us. By this point in time we noticed that they stopped calling names and even people that had just walked in were getting lanes. When we decided to walk up to the counter and ask why we hadn\\'t been called yet, the only response we got from the guy was : \"Ohh\" ... As in they completely forgot about us and were caught handing out lanes to everyone while we had been patiently waiting for hours. No apology or anything whatsoever. We brushed it off and just chose to pay for our lane since we had already wasted 2+ hours at this place. Once we finally got our chance to bowl, our only hope was to have fun and enjoy our time there together only to find out that the lanes sucked, the ambience was terrible and their customer service was just horrible. I will not return to this place at all knowing that their staff is completely distracted, lazy and just flat out don\\'t care. The people working that night were a young blonde chick and a young guy with a XOXO tattoo on his left forearm. Stay away unless you like to deal with frustration.',\n",

I should probably make sure I get the OK anyway, right?\\n\\nThe Mob Museum is in Downtown Las Vegas in the old courthouse/post office.  The way it works is, you purchase your tickets on the first floor and you start on the third floor and work your way down.  It's a self guided tour that starts with a fun picture opportunity where you get to pretend you're in a line-up with other criminals behind the tinted one-way glass.  The tour basically takes you through the history of the mob chronologically, with artifacts and videos to look at and watch, and includes some very interesting things that I have never known, such as, the numbers of people in the Mafia who served in the Armed Forces, or who had family who served.  Interestingly enough, O'Hare airport is named after the WWII naval flying ace Edward Henry O'Hare, whose father is none other than Edward Joseph O'Hare, former lawyer/partner-in-crime to Al Capone.  \\n\\nThere's so much to see and learn, if you really want to get the most out of your money, you should plan to spend a minimum of 2 hours to get from the top to bottom.  If I was here alone, I would probably spend 4 hours here so that I could really take it all in.  \\n\\nAfter this you should probably go to Mermaid's and get a fried twinkie or something.\",\n",

If you're one of these people, don't travel to any European city, as you'll be whining just to get to the end of the street.\\n\\nMention has also been made of a perfume that's piped into the AC of the lobby. True - and it's smells nice! I understand that it can bother those with a very sensitive nose but for the vast majority, it just helps make a nice environment (while we're on the subject of smells, the lotions and soaps provided in the rooms smell lovely).\\n\\nService was excellent. So many great individual interactions with staff who just excel at their roles and are super friendly. \\n\\nThe room condition was excellent. Spacious ( very ), big beds and well furnished. Love the huge bathroom with double sinks, big tub and shower. Don't really know why the kitchenettes are there but not an issue. A TV in the bathroom mirror was just fun for its own sake. Odd design issue - couldn't find a single, central switch for all the lights. My personal highlight was the massage jets in the bathtub - if you stay here, you must try them out!\\n\\nThe resort fees seems to be the norm in Vegas and the general ethos in America. As a European, I prefer the price to be the price, taxes and all included. This extends to the valet-only parking, which is just an annoyance and not a luxury (i.e. valet in general is a silly American concept - if I'm driving a car, I can bloody well park it myself or I shouldn't be driving in the first place. And if I have a really nice car, why the hell would I let some stranger with limited education drive and potentially damage it?). Don't get me started on tipping which is just a way to degrade the working class to the status of plebs but I digress. I would definitely take note of the fact that parking at the adjacent mall is free, so is a faster option if you just want to pop in and out.\\n\\nUsed the gym - lovely and everything was in excellent condition with hand towels provided. The pool wasn't a party type of place, just a really nice luxury hotel pool.\\n\\nMy only issue, and one that might be unfair, is that when traveling in Europe, hotels always include breakfast. Doesn't seem to be the case here but if no-one else is doing it, then it's unfair to pick on any one hotel.\\n\\nMy companions mentioned that they can hear the train horn at various times during the night, so that can be an issue if you're a light sleeper. It's funny though - some reviews complain about the train noise but want to be on the strip, which surely generates much more noise at all hours!?\\n\\n4 pm checkout also helped us maximize the value of our time in Vegas, though, again there's the mall parking as an option.\\n\\nAnother reviewer noted the weak water pressure from the shower. That bothered me too but I'm not sure why it exists - it makes sense from a water conservation perspective ( I'm all for that ) and that the Kohler fittings are water-efficient but then the bath water pressure is higher and taking baths is far more water-inefficient than showers. Odd.\\n\\nThe other clientele are middle to upper class, often professionals and well-travelled foreigners. Not to sound too much like a snob but birds of a feather...\\n\\nThe hotel bar closes way too early. Hotel bars are a great way to meet people, whether at the start of the evening or late night for one last drink. \\n\\nBottom line : While in Vegas, I will ONLY stay at The Trump Hotel... but maybe not dine at the hotel restaurant until there's new management, as it seems to have some well publicized issues!\",\n",
